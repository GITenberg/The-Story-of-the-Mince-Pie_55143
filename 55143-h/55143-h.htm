<h2>THE STORY OF THE MINCE PIE</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Sing a Song o’ sixpence a pocket full of rye,</div>
<div class="line">Four and twenty Dollies baked in a pie,</div>
<div class="line">When the pie was opened the Dolls began to sing,</div>
<div class="line">Wasn’t that an odd dish to set before the King?”</div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> have heard of many kinds of pie, but
did you ever hear of a Doll pie?</p>

<p>No one ever did, I am sure, and no
one knew the pie was full of dolls; everybody
supposed it was just a plain mince
pie; the kind that makes your eyes twinkle,
and makes you smack your lips when you
sniff it baking.</p>

<p>I have always thought it was the kind Jack
Horner had when he sat in the corner and
pulled out a plum, but never did I dream
that he might have pulled out a doll!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>


<p>I found it out in such an extremely funny
and unexpected way that I must tell you all
about it.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve. Jack’s father was
away but coming home on the morrow in time
for all the Christmas doings.</p>

<p>We had locked up the house and were
just going upstairs to bed when Jack exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Mother, you know the mince pie you
baked to-day? We must take it up to bed
with us!”</p>

<p>“A pie, a mince pie to bed with us?” I cried
in amazement, as I thought of the spicy delicious
thing safely stowed away on the
pantry shelf.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother, you know there is a mouse.
It ate up my gingerbread doll; didn’t leave
even a crumb. How would we feel if it ate
up our mince pie!”</p>

<p>That was true. There had been a mouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
spying about of late, and so I said all right,
we would.</p>

<p>I carried it up very carefully, and we stood
in the middle of the room looking about for
a good place to put it.</p>

<p>It was a bitter night. The maid had built
a grand fire of logs, and they crackled and
snapped a Christmas greeting as we stood
seeking a resting place for the pie.</p>

<p>“I see a fine spot!” cried Jack, as he ran
to the big grandfather clock, and sure enough
it was. A shelf just under the pendulum
that seemed made on purpose for a pie. We
placed it there and covered it carefully with
a napkin.</p>

<p>“The pie is going to bed, too,” I said, as
I snuggled it up under its cover.</p>

<p>Jack shouted over this, and we both had
a merry time undressing before the jolly fire.</p>

<p>We hung up our stockings and one for
Father, then hopped into bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>Jack nestled up close and begged for a bedtime
story, which I always told him. A
drowsy tale which sent him to sleep, and me,
too, before it was barely finished.</p>

<p>I really didn’t know I was asleep, but suddenly
a queer sound startled me, and as I
listened I heard Jack smothering a giggle.</p>

<p>“What is it, dear?” I whispered.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, such a funny thing! I
heard the clock chain rattle, and I looked
and the mouse ran up the clock, and I heard
voices singing: ‘Hickory Dickory Dock.’
Now look quick!”</p>

<p>We both stared at the napkin over the pie,
for it began to get humpy. You have played
“tent” under the bedclothes, of course.</p>

<p>Well, there seemed a dozen somethings
playing that game, for the napkin humped up
here and there till presently it was lifted off
and fell to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>It was just like a matinée. The napkin
seemed to be the curtain rolled away, then
the show began.</p>

<p>We heard queer voices singing, and then
we saw such a sight! Out of that pie filed a
lot of dolls, the strangest looking dolls any
one ever saw.</p>

<p>One seemed to be made of raisins; another
of currants&mdash;the dried sugary kind. One
had a round apple for a head, and such rosy
cheeks it looked like a blooming country maid
wearing a Dutch blue gown and an apron as
white as snow.</p>

<p>Back of her was a brownie, holding the
hand of a creamy white fat boy. Following
them was a group, one had a round nut-like
head; another was stuck full of what
looked like cloves; another was tall and thin
just like a stick. With him was a pair of
twins. They looked for all the world like
salt and pepper boxes. They were much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
smaller than the others and teetered on the
edge of the pie like tiny fairies.</p>

<p>Then came another pair, one with an orange
for a head, the other a lemon. As they
pranced along, their fluffy orange and yellow
skirts stood out like ballet dancers.</p>

<p>Then came a dumpy maid all sparkly
white.</p>

<p>“She’s the shape of a fat sugar bowl,
Mother!” whispered Jack, and, sure enough,
she looked as though she had walked right off
the tea tray.</p>

<p>Following her came one with a small oval
brown head, looking so wise.</p>

<p>With her was one with a large green head.</p>

<p>Back of them strode another pair; one looking
like a molasses jug, the other like a vinegar
cruet.</p>

<p>Such a funny lot as they were!</p>

<p>We looked and laughed, and laughed and
looked. They raced about on the very edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
of the crust as though they were playing Ring
around a Rosy; then at a signal from the tall
thin fellow they ran down the spiral column
of the clock over to the hearth.</p>

<p>“We can have a Christmas dance right
here,” cried the rosy-cheeked apple maid; at
this joyful news they switched off their
sashes.</p>

<p>The tall thin one fastened the ends to the
top of an andiron, and there in the firelight
we saw a dance, such as no one ever saw before.
Round and round they danced, till
the iron was bound with ribbon to its very
base; then the little creatures threw themselves
on the hearth.</p>

<p>“Let’s play school!” cried the tall thin
Stick Doll, who seemed to be chairman for
the occasion.</p>

<p>“Mercy, no!” cried another. “I don’t like
school. I don’t want to learn things.”</p>

<p>“I said let’s <i>play</i> school. We don’t have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
to learn anything. It will be fun. We’ll
each tell a story.”</p>

<p>“A story!” echoed the whole bunch.</p>

<p>“What kind of a story?”</p>

<p>“A true story.”</p>

<p>“We don’t know any,” they all sighed.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do. You all know fine
stories, and if you’ll tell them, something
grand is going to happen!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the audience.</p>

<p>“This is the one night of all the year when
wonderful things happen.”</p>

<p>With wide open eyes and mouths they
crept closer to the speaker, and listened
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“This is Christmas Eve. Didn’t you hear
the mouse go up the clock? It’s hiding and
watching. Pretend you aren’t looking, but
see the two bright eyes peering at us, just at
the end by the big hand. It wants the pie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>As long as we are here it will not come down.
That is a Christmas pie for the Christmas
dinner to-morrow.</p>

<div class="caption">“They’ve been peeking in that big book”</div>
</div>

<p>“If we go back the mouse will run down
and gobble us all up. So there is nothing for
us to do but stay here. It’s a long time till
morning, and we better do something while
we wait. How can we better while away
the time than with stories? We dare not go
to sleep, you know. If you’ll each tell a
story you can have a gift, too.”</p>

<p>“A gift!” cried the chorus. “Well, that
would be worth while. Pray tell us what
will the gift be?”</p>

<p>“That’s a secret I am not allowed to tell.
The reason is, because I do not know.”</p>

<p>“He does not know. He does not know,”
sang the chorus, running down the scale as
a mouse runs across the piano keys.</p>

<p>“Well,” cried the wee Salt and Pepper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Pair which seemed inseparable, “since you
know so much, you better begin the story-hour.”</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE RAISIN DOLL</h2>


<p>“I speak to be the teacher,” cried the Raisin
Doll.</p>

<p>“Very well, you must tell the first story,
then.”</p>

<p>“What must the stories be about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is only one thing to tell. We
must each tell our history from the time we
were born, in order to have the gift.”</p>

<p>“Will the gift be good to eat?” asked the
creamy white Fat Boy.</p>

<p>“Best ever you tasted. That’s all I could
find out about it. Now begin.”</p>

<p>The Raisin Doll pranced over to the end
of the hearth, made a quick bow, and politely
began:</p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen:”</p>

<p>Everybody giggled, but he went bravely
on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t seem to remember the day I was
born.”</p>

<p>“Not many do,” whispered one to another.</p>

<p>“It isn’t polite to interrupt,” frowned the
speaker.</p>

<p>“The first thing I remember a whole bunch
of us was hanging from a vine&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha!” shouted the chorus. “A
whole bunch of him was hanging from a
vine!”</p>

<p>“Well, there was a whole bunch of us, and
as I looked about I saw many bunches and
many, many vines.</p>

<p>“It was beautiful there in the sunlight. I
never saw such glorious sunshine&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where?” cried the audience.</p>

<p>“In a place called California.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?” asked one.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell us; we don’t want to know,”
hastily cried the audience. “We aren’t to
learn things here in this school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>“I won’t tell you. I’ll show you,” and the
speaker hopped on to the large globe that
stood in the corner.</p>

<p>He slid down one side and placed his big
toe on the spot where California claimed to
be.</p>

<p>They all watched his antics closely, for
in their hearts they did want to know where
those bunches of grapes grew, even though
they didn’t seem to want to learn anything.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly where my bunch of grapes
grew, but I have cousins called Malagas and
Muscatels who come from Spain.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to know where that is, of
course. I am now going to take a little run
around the world. Pretend I’m a top spinning,
and the spot where I stop and twirl will
be where my relatives live. When it’s time
to twirl I’ll squeak and you can then close
your eyes for the moment, so you won’t add
anything to your store of knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>“For my part, I would feel quite pleased
if I were sailing around the world and could
say, ‘Oh, Mr. Captain, just stop a few moments
in Mediterranean Spain. I want a
pocket full of raisins to eat; the layer kind,
big fat juicy ones’; or if I were pudding hungry
I’d wheedle him a little. I’d say, ‘Now,
Captain dear, I’d just like to run into Valencia.
We need a few pudding raisins. We’ll
have a pudding that’ll melt in your mouth if
we can go there.’</p>

<p>“I think that’s much better than to stand
around with my mouth open, and when we
steam into these places be wondering what
grows there, and why we stopped.”</p>

<p>That was a new idea. Journeys on ships
were fun, and how proud one would feel to
be able to show the Captain just where to
go for certain things.</p>

<p>“Mother,” whispered Jack, “let’s watch
where he twirls. Maybe a captain might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
even beg us to go and show him where raisins
grow, so he can bring back a shipload of
them!”</p>

<p>The Raisin Doll now skipped gaily along
as though he were going to the corner grocery
for a stick of candy.</p>

<p>The audience gazed fascinated, and instead
of closing eyes as he squeaked, they
hardly dared wink for fear they might miss
some of that raisin country.</p>

<p>“Where is he now?” one and another whispered
as he paused and twirled, crying:</p>

<p>“There! There is the very spot where
many of my cousins live, and because they
live there instead of in California they are
much sweeter.”</p>

<p>“Tell us why, tell us why,” clamoured the
audience.</p>

<p>“For a very good reason. We are picked
in bunches and dried in an oven in sugar.
They are dried in the sun, and are called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
sun raisins. Their leaves are taken off, and
a jolly time they have in the sunshine and
fresh air. A much better way than to be
shut in an oven in the dark.</p>

<p>“However, we have to make the best of it;
the cool nights and heavy dews would ruin
us if we stayed out, so we just cuddle up in
the nice warm dark, and look forward to the
moment when the big oven door will fly open,
then we know something nice is to happen,
for America sends millions of pounds of raisins
to other countries, and we just love to go.</p>

<p>“The sun raisins are the kind used for
Christmas goodies, and are packed between
layers of paper in large wooden boxes.</p>

<p>“Other places they come from are here, and
here, and here, and here.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he twirled over various parts
of the globe, touching Persia, Greece, Italy,
and Southern France.</p>

<p>“It is quite grand to be a sun raisin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
come in a box looking so large and delicious,
and to know you are the finest of your kind,
but I’d just about as soon be a pudding raisin,
when the Cook comes in and says:</p>

<p>“‘Dear suz me, Missus, we can’t have pudding
to-day!’</p>

<p>“Then all the children set up a dismal wail
and Missus says, ‘Why not, I’d like to
know!’</p>

<p>“‘Because we are just out of pudding raisins,’
but she adds cheerfully, ‘We have the
layer kind. Could we use those?’</p>

<p>“‘Certainly not,’ says the Missus, with her
head up like this and her mouth turned down
like this. ‘They cost too much. We’ll have
to have something else.’</p>

<p>“Then at dinner the Mister cries, ‘Why
didn’t we have pudding to-day; we always
have it on Tuesday!’</p>

<p>“‘Cause no pudding raisins in the house,’
cry the children, sniffing again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Send for a barrel of them,’ orders the
Mister. ‘When that gives out, get another
at once. When I have my mouth made up
for pudding on Tuesdays I don’t want to be
disappointed.’</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that make a cute little pudding
raisin hug herself?</p>

<p>“Another kind of raisin grows here in
Smyrna; they are the small seedless kind.”</p>

<p>“The Corinthian raisin currant&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Boo! hoo! hoo!” interrupted somebody,
apparently much grieved.</p>

<p>“Who’s crying like that?” asked the Raisin
Doll.</p>

<p>“I am,” came in sobbing tones.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked everybody, standing on tip
toe to see the weeping one.</p>

<p>“He’s telling my story. There isn’t much
to tell about me, and if he tells it, I can’t;
then I won’t get a gift!”</p>

<p>“To be sure you won’t!” said the tall Stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Doll. “Mr. Raisin, are you going to tell
everybody’s story, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said the Raisin Doll, a bit
fussed over the uproar; “I forgot that one of
my cousins was present.</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE CURRANT DOLL</h2>


<p>“Allow me to introduce to you the light-hearted,
joyous-natured Corinthian raisin
Currant.”</p>

<p>The light-hearted, joyous-natured Currant
Doll wiped his tears away as he bowed and
wailed:</p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen, I am, though
maybe I don’t look it.”</p>

<p>“Am what?” queried the audience sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Am what he said&mdash;light hearted and gay&mdash;and
though my story is short I am just as
important as any of you. What good would
a bun be without currants? Just tell me
that!” he cried in tragic tones, striking such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
a funny attitude even Mother stifled a giggle.</p>

<p>“I came from a beautiful vine that grows
in the lowlands of Zante of the Ionian Islands
belonging to Greece. I’ll show you
the very spot.”</p>

<p>Here the audience was much surprised to
see the light-hearted creature turn a somersault
down the slippery side of the globe and
land in a nest of small dots.</p>

<p>“These are islands,” he announced, “and
here the vines are planted in neat little rows
three feet apart. Our grapes are like berries
no larger than a pea, and grow in clusters
about three inches long.</p>

<p>“When about three years old the vine produces
bunches of three kinds; red, black, and
white grapes without seeds. We play hide
and seek under the large leaves which protect
us from the strong winds and hot sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>“When we have grown as large as we can
we are picked, dried, packed, and sent many
miles away. That’s all.”</p>

<p>And he sat down so hard he bounced up
again like a rubber ball.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the Currant!” cried the
Stick Doll. “He seems to have grown up
under the figure three, and that brings good
luck.</p>

<p>“Now, who wants to tell next?”</p>

<p>Nobody moved, and the Stick Doll cried:</p>

<p>“We’ll decide it by playing Ring around
a Rosy. The last one down will be it.
Come, hold hands, circle, and sing.”</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE CLOVE DOLL</h2>


<p>Round and round they went, singing to
an accompaniment of rollicking laughter,
and at the words: “Hush, hush, hush, we
all fall down,” they fell in a heap, the Clove
Doll being the last to fall.</p>

<p>“Allow me,” cried the Stick Doll, as he
gallantly set Miss Clove on her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>“We will now have the pleasure of listening
to this spicy creature. She surely has a
fine story to tell.”</p>

<p>Miss Clove had been slyly studying the
dictionary, and longed to impress the audience
with the wonderful story of her life.
She smoothed her crimson sash, perked the
butterfly bow on her hair till it seemed almost
ready to fly away, and with cheeks as
red as her ribbons began timidly.</p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen: I am an undeveloped
bud&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” cried one, who looked much
like a vinegar cruet. “That is a joke!”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded the Stick Doll.</p>

<p>“She said undeveloped.”</p>

<p>“So she did, what of it? You may tell
us what the word means.”</p>

<p>The sour-looking one, much confused,
stalked away as he murmured under his
breath,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>“We aren’t to learn anything here, I
thought.”</p>

<p>“No, but if you knew the meaning of it,
you would answer very promptly, so the joke
is on you. The speaker can, of course, tell
us.”</p>

<p>The Clove Doll’s cheeks flushed even redder
than before, and wished with all her heart
she had not used the large word of which she
was so proud.</p>

<p>“I am sure I cannot tell what it means.
It’s what I am, and it’s the way my story begins.”</p>

<p>“Who knows what the very large word
used by the very small one means?” asked
the Stick Doll, of the audience.</p>

<p>The Pepper and Salt Twins now stepped
forward. They swayed from side to side
and in sing-song tones cried:</p>

<p>“Un means not. Undeveloped means not
developed; developed means finished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>“Excellent memory you have,” said the
Stick Doll.</p>

<p>“They’ve been peeking in that big book,
too; I saw them,” cried the Vinegar Cruet.
“Any one could do that.”</p>

<p>“Tell tale tit, your tongue shall be slit,”
sang the whole crowd.</p>

<p>“Here! Here! This won’t do. Come,
let us hear the rest of the story of this unfinished
maid.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t true that I am not finished! As a
clove I am complete and perfect. It is only
that the buds are used before they are quite
ready to turn into blossoms.</p>

<p>“If my buds were allowed to blossom there
would never be a clove. What would the
pickled peach do then, poor thing?”</p>

<p>
“She’d stay in her jar,<br />
And soon be sour,<br />
And moulder away on the shelf, poor thing!”<br />
</p>

<p>promptly sang the audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>At this Jack and Mother hid their heads
in the blankets, shaking with laughter, and
came forth with very red faces just in time
to hear Miss Clove continue her spicy tale.</p>

<p>“The clove tree grows in the woods in hot
countries, specially here and here, and here.”</p>

<p>“She’s on roller skates,” whispered Jack,
as the Clove Lady sailed quickly and gracefully
around the globe, touching with her
wheeled feet Zanzibar, Brazil, and the West
Indies.</p>

<p>“The audience need not note especially
the countries pointed out,” said the Stick
Doll, “but it is to me most interesting.
You may continue.”</p>

<p>The Clove Doll had snatched the moment
while she waited to again improve her mind
through the big book, and now announced
importantly:</p>

<p>“I am very pungent. That means aromatic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the Vinegar Cruet, “you had
to shut the book too quick to find the meaning
of that, but I happen to know it.</p>

<p>“Why are you like me?”</p>

<p>“Happy thought,” said the Stick Doll;
“let’s turn this into a puzzle contest. Why
is the clove like vinegar?”</p>

<p>“Give it up. Give it up. What’s the answer?”
sang the audience.</p>

<p>“Because we are both sharp,” politely answered
the Vinegar Cruet, strutting about
like a peacock.</p>

<p>“Sharp! Ha! Ha!” cried Pepper and Salt.
“S’pose you’ve been visiting the scissors’
grinder.”</p>

<p>“Vinegar is right,” said the Clove Doll.
“We are both smart.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Let’s all carry a
pocket dictionary and we can be smart and
sharp, too,” laughed some one.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” cried the Clove Doll. “Did I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
really say smart? I mis-spoke. I am sharp.
I mean stinging to the tongue.”</p>

<p>Before she could say another word she was
surrounded and tested so vigorously by the
many tongues, she shrieked indignantly:</p>

<p>“Stop! we don’t lick the ladder till the ice
cream is done. Now let me finish.</p>

<p>“My buds turn green, then red and hard.
Then we are laid near the smoke of a wood
fire in the sun to dry. We don’t like that
smudge and are glad enough when we turn
brown, then we know we are finished. I
might say developed,” she added, with a triumphant
glance at her hearers.</p>



<hr />
<h2>DANCE OF THE ELVES</h2>


<p>“The last night there in the woods we had
a grand time. We looked like a lot of elves
dancing in the red glow shed by the fire.</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget what happened that
night. We had just finished a weird dance
and were huddled together watching the
sparks mount to the sky, when there ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>peared
in our midst a queer little Being, who
seemed to spring from the fire.</p>

<p>“She seated herself in our midst and told
us the grandest stories I ever heard!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Allspice, “I wish she would
come here!”</p>

<p>At that instant they heard a far-off voice.
It seemed to come from the flames. Singing,
singing, nearer and nearer.</p>



<hr />
<h2>THE STORY SPRITE’S TALE</h2>


<p>Suddenly from the very centre of the fire
sprang a wonderful vision, a tiny creature,
who seemed clothed in wreaths of flame.
With a joyous greeting, as jolly as the fire
itself, she cried:</p>

<p>“Your wish is granted. Behold, the Story
Sprite! Since I attended the clove party I
have been around the world and have a fine
collection of tales.</p>

<p>“I am fresh from Japan, now, where I saw
enacted a most exciting tale. Creep close to
my feet while I tell it. I wish you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
see the children in Japan. They are so beautiful;
clad in their brilliant coloured kimonos,
they look like a mass of poppies nodding
in the wind.</p>

<p>“One dear little Japanese maid did such a
splendid thing!</p>

<p>“Without speaking a word, with only her
dear two hands, she saved a young man from
being imprisoned for life. He was an American
gentleman, who had been sent to Japan
on business.</p>

<p>“He was lonely so far from home, and became
very friendly with Cherry Blossom, the
child of one with whom he had business relations.</p>

<p>“He was very much interested in the queer
games she played, and spent much time with
her.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="500" height="711" alt="Great sport they had flying wonderful kites" />
<div class="caption">“Great sport they had flying wonderful kites”</div>
</div>

<p>“Great sport they had flying wonderful
kites that looked like gorgeous birds with
outspread wings, or maybe seated on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>beach she would make sand pictures, which
were her great delight.</p>

<p>“They usually wound up these visits with
a tea-party. The child seated opposite him,
looking like a brilliant butterfly, poised for
a moment as she handed him the fragile cup
filled with the fragrant beverage.</p>

<p>“In time he became very dear to her, and
one day while playing with her dolly she
overheard something that sorely troubled her
little heart. Her father was talking in low
mysterious tones to some Japanese friends.
Suddenly she heard the American’s name.
She pricked up her ears.</p>

<p>“Dear! Dear! Such startling news she
could hardly believe.</p>

<p>“They thought he was a spy and were going
to put him in prison very soon! They
walked away, leaving the child grief-stricken.</p>

<p>“What a spy was, she did not know; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
what she did know was that her precious
friend must be saved from that awful fate,
for once in prison he might never be released.</p>

<p>“He had told her of his own little girl,
who was even now, in that far away land
called America, watching for his home coming.
As she gazed off seaward she saw a
ship that might sail any day. He must go
on it and she must tell him why, but how
could she?</p>

<p>“Never was she allowed to be alone with
him for one moment. Always when playing
her childish games with him, her nurse sat
near by, within hearing of her voice, her
beady eyes watching her every movement.</p>

<p>“As the child pondered on this startling
state of affairs, her friend suddenly appeared.
At once the nurse glided to her
post.</p>

<p>“‘See the ship,’ he cried in her native lan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>guage.
‘It will sail this evening. The next
ship that comes will take me home to my
baby. Let’s go and buy her a doll.’</p>

<p>“To the shop they went, the nurse trotting
along beside them.</p>

<p>“They bought a wonderful doll, an exact
copy of Cherry Blossom in her silken robes.</p>

<p>“They bought many other toys, among
them a complete outfit for making sand pictures.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll tell my baby how you helped me to
choose her doll. Now let’s go to the beach
and you bring your sand bags and teach me
how to make the pictures so I can make them
for her.’</p>

<p>“Happy thought! Now maybe she could
have an instant, just a weenty instant alone
with him, and so she asked the nurse to bring
the bags of sand.</p>

<p>“‘You come, too,’ whispered the nurse,
and refused to budge without the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>“Japanese children must be obedient, and
she followed, not even daring to allow her
little feet to lag or to seem disturbed in any
way.</p>

<p>“She was soon seated on the beach close
beside her friend, while the nurse sat a little
apart knitting, her eyes fixed on the pair.</p>

<p>“Making pictures in the sand is a wonderful
game, a game the Japanese children
adore.</p>

<p>“They have three bags of coloured sand
and one of white. It is most fascinating to
see them spread in the form of a square the
white sand, till it resembles a sheet of white
paper. On this with black and red, yellow
or blue, they produce wonderful landscape
effects.</p>

<p>“Cherry Blossom plunged her hands into
the bags, her thoughts far away from the
game.</p>

<p>“Suddenly her eyes flashed. She knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
how to give him the message. Why hadn’t
she thought of it before! Pictures could tell
most anything, and so she eagerly began.</p>

<p>“Immediately from her tiny fingers the
varicoloured sand trickled in a thin stream.</p>

<p>“At first as he idly watched, he saw in her
picture a bit of sea, on which presently appeared
a ship with spreading sail. On the
fluffy white waves, creeping up to the shore,
rocked a tiny boat. On the land appeared
a prison, a perfect copy of one he had seen
many times. In the small boat an American
was seated.</p>

<p>“The man watched in tense silence. The
child was telling him something. He lit a
cigarette with unsteady hands, but as he remembered
the sentinel on guard, he began to
hum a tune.</p>

<p>“The child’s hands never trembled as she
next produced a number of Japanese gentlemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>“Now the man disappeared from the boat,
and at once was seen peering through the
prison bars.</p>

<p>“Just here the nurse suspiciously drew
near to see the picture.</p>

<p>“The man quickly pointed to the sky, crying
gaily, ‘See the birds!’</p>

<p>“As the nurse gazed Skyward, one swift
stroke of his hand destroyed the picture, and
he said quietly:</p>

<p>“‘Now let me make one. You do them so
well I am afraid you will think I am a bungler,
but I want to try.’</p>

<p>“As he worked, he whistled a merry tune,
and the child felt that he meant her to know
he understood. She soon saw that he, too,
was picturing a message, for in the twinkling
of an eye he had fashioned a tree, its green
branches stretching out over the white background.</p>

<p>“On a low branch he placed a bird. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
seemed to be making an effort to free itself
from a thong which held its little foot.
From its beak fluttered a banner. Under his
fingers this banner was soon transfigured into
an American flag.</p>

<p>“As the man worked, the merry tune was
replaced by sharp twitters and chirps as
though the bird were distressed.</p>

<p>“The child watched fascinated, as underneath
the tree she saw a Japanese child taking
shape. Her fingers rested on the bird’s
foot, and suddenly by a quick twirl of his
hand the bird was blotted out and in an instant
plainly to be seen poised on the mast
of a ship, carolling a glad song of freedom.</p>

<p>“Then the picture was swept away, and
with one look into the child’s beautiful eyes,
a look that told volumes, he gathered up his
purchases and sauntered away.</p>

<p>“In his room he hastily packed his belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>ings,
and later on under cover of the darkness
he was safely stowed on the ship.</p>

<p>“As Cherry Blossom drowsily closed her
eyes she heard the ship’s shrill whistle as it
steamed away, and she rejoiced that she had
been able with her own little hands to send
her dear friend back to his baby.</p>

<p>“There was great excitement the next day
when it was learned the American had vanished.</p>

<p>“The nurse was closely questioned.
Never had she left the child alone, and her
mother also declared that she too had been
on guard, and all she saw was that they made
pictures in the sand without even a word.</p>

<p>“And so the secret never was told till now,
and it will still be a secret, for pie people
never never tell, and now good-bye till you
wish for me again.”</p>

<p>With a graceful courtesy the Story Sprite
vanished as suddenly as she had appeared,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>and the audience sat for a moment listening
spellbound to her song fast dying away.</p>

<p>Then long-drawn breaths were heard and
the Clove Doll cried, “Wasn’t she perfect?
I never dreamed she would come here, but I
am glad she did.</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE ALLSPICE DOLL</h2>


<p>“Now will my cousin, Miss Allspice,
please step forward and tell her story.”</p>

<p>This dear little doll timidly made her way
back of the speaker, and, holding shyly
to her skirt, peeped out, and said in low
tones:</p>

<p>“I am just a small round berry from the
Pimento. A wee evergreen tree that grows
on the limestone hills, on the Islands of the
West Indies.</p>

<p>“We are about the size of a pea, gathered
in August, and dried in the sun for several
days. The stems are then taken off and we
are packed in a bag and sent to America.</p>

<p>“There such a thing happened to us as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
would never believe possible. We were
turned out of the bags, looking like a lot of
dried hard peas. We were so happy to be at
the end of our journey, and see daylight
again.</p>

<p>“We smiled up at the blue sky as we merrily
rolled out of the sacks, but, alas, our
joy was only for a moment, as we found ourselves
turned into a grinder of some sort.
Suddenly we heard a whizzing sound, and
there we had turned from peas into a fine
powder.</p>

<p>“They named us Allspice because we have
the flavour of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves,
and everybody loves us.”</p>

<p>Out of breath, the modest little creature
completely vanished in Clove’s skirt, blown
there by the applause which now filled the
room.</p>

<p>“Well done!” cried the Stick Doll. “You
mean a lot if you are small. Now I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
we should hear from the Nutmeg, since spice
seems to hold our attention at present.”</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE NUTMEG DOLL</h2>


<p>The doll with the small brown head now
arose and walked over to the place of honour.
She was a study in green. Her gown was
formed of leaves from the tree upon which
she grew, and an artistic picture she made
as she faced her audience.</p>

<p>“My dear friends,” she said, and paused.</p>

<p>“I take my pen in hand to say I am well&mdash;”
came in an audible whisper.</p>

<p>“And hope you are the same,” flashed the
Nutmeg. “I admit I was a bit flurried.
But thanks to your hurried letter just received
I am myself again. I need to be, for
I am rather interesting.</p>

<p>“I come chiefly from the Banda Islands,
and some of my poor relations come from the
West Indies and Brazil, where dear little
Allspice lives.</p>

<p>“She forgot to welcome you to her home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and I will show you where it is,” and she
took from her pocket some tiny round balls
and tossed them in various directions.</p>

<p>To the surprise of all, the balls lodged and
stuck, and the onlookers were so interested
in learning whether they stuck where they
should they forgot they weren’t to learn anything.</p>

<p>“They did!” whispered Jack and Mother
in one breath, and, sure enough, some lodged
in the Banda Islands, others in the West Indies.</p>

<p>“Some of us live in South America,” and
she lightly tossed a few more balls, all of
which clung to their native lands.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by poor relations?”
asked the Stick Doll.</p>

<p>“I mean the poorer quality of nutmegs.
The Brazilian nutmeg brings oil for hard
soap and candles.</p>

<p>“I am the better quality, and am the ker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>nel
of a fruit which is round and about the
size of a walnut.</p>

<p>“The outside coat is two inches across before
it splits open, and the nutmeg, of course,
comes out, just as the chestnut falls from
the burr. A network of tiny fibres is wound
about it, and this second coat is dried and
ground and called mace.</p>

<p>“The olive-shaped nut, about an inch in
length, is turned over every day for two
months, and treated with lime to preserve it.
Then it is the nutmeg which you see before
you.”</p>

<p>“What are you good for, please, Mam?”
asked the Vinegar Cruet with a sour expression.</p>

<p>“What am I good for?” she cried indignantly.
“What am I not good for? Look
in the cook-book on the pantry shelf and see
if there is anything worth while that hasn’t
a dash of me in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll find every good housewife has one
of me in a tiny grater hanging where she can
find it in the dark. Your puddings, and
pies, and gingerbreads, and cakes, and blanc-manges,
and egg noggs, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Here! Here! my dear lady, we can’t wait
to let you go through the whole cook-book.
We’ll take your word for it. Now since I
seem to belong to the same family, perhaps
I had better entertain you next.</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE CINNAMON DOLL</h2>


<p>“I am called Cinnamon, and I’m just about
as spicy as any of you. I am exactly as important
to the pickled peaches as is Miss
Clove, and where would the coffee cake be
without me, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>He paused and gazed about in a dramatic
way that convulsed Jack, who whispered:</p>

<p>“Isn’t he funny, Mother, so long and lank,
and such an expression I never saw!”</p>

<p>“Did any of you ever hear of cinnamon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
candy?” continued the speaker. “Could it
be cinnamon candy without me?”</p>

<p>As no one replied to this, he cried:</p>

<p>“Certainly not! and now I will show you
where I grow. It is right here,” and, with
one stride of his long legs one foot rested on
the Island of Ceylon in the Indian Ocean
near Persia.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Cinnamon, but where did
you get your seven-league boots?” asked the
Vinegar Cruet.</p>

<p>“They grew on me, so I didn’t need to buy
them. You can’t tease me that way. I can’t
help it because I am long legged any more
than you can help looking sour. When you
turn sweet I’ll have short legs; that’s a bargain.
Send me an invitation to your candy
pull.</p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen, please excuse this
rude interruption, and I will proceed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>“When the cinnamon trees are almost two
years old small branches are cut off and the
outer bark removed, leaving the inner bark,
which is then peeled off and dried.</p>

<p>“In drying it takes the form of rolls called
quills, the smaller ones, as they dry, are
thrust into the larger. Sometimes it is
ground fine and packed in bags.</p>

<p>“I am not only used in flavouring food, but
in many medicines.</p>

<p>“Now I think the spices have finished their
tales, and we can have a complete change of
programme.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Allspice, “before we go on
let’s have the Story Sprite again.”</p>

<p>“Is it your desire that the Story Sprite appear?”
asked Cinnamon Stick. “If so, Allspice
and I will break this wishbone I see
hanging over the hearth.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Do! Do!” cried one and all.</p>

<p>“Very well, we will both wish for her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
come, then we can’t possibly fail whichever
way it breaks.”</p>

<p>And so snap went the bone, but much dismayed
they were when it was found each
held the short end, for the centre had taken
to itself wings.</p>

<p>“Oh, I <i>wish</i> she would come anyhow!”
they chorused, and once more from the flames
sprang the Story Elf.</p>

<p>“You do not need to break wishbones to
bring me. All that is necessary is just to
<i>wish</i>, and here I am,” she announced.</p>

<p>“This time I want to tell you more about
a story you all know very well. It is called:</p>
<hr />
<h2>
AND PIPED THOSE CHILDREN BACK AGAIN.
</h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Don’t</span> you love the Pied Piper story, and
didn’t your heart almost stop beating when
the door in the mountain closed, shutting the
children in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>“And though you were glad one mother
had her dear little boy left behind, no doubt
your tears mingled with his as he limped
alone down the mountain path trying in vain
to comfort himself with the fleeting glimpse
he had of that joyous country where the
horses had wings and the bees no stings;
where the birds were brighter than peacocks
here and flowers of rare beauty grew in profusion.</p>

<p>“Can’t you just see his beautiful, upturned,
angel face? How could that great
door close and leave <i>him</i> on the wrong side!</p>

<p>“But let me tell you a splendid fact.
Sometimes the things that seem all wrong
are the grandest things that ever happened,
and true it is, though it may seem hard to
believe, this little fellow was really on the
right side of the door after all. And though
he seemed shut out from the glad times
awaiting them in that blissful land, just be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>cause
of this he was able to ring the joy bells
of the village with his own hands because he
was the only one there who could finally
enter the magic door and carry the message
that brought the children to their own again.
And now I must tell you this beautiful thing
that happened:</p>

<p>“After the little hamlet was bereft of her
children the parents turned sadly back to
their homes, while the muffled tones of the
Pied Piper came no more to their ears.</p>

<p>“They could hardly believe it true. It
must be a bad dream from which they would
soon awaken.</p>

<p>“Many times a day the thrifty housewives
stepped to their doors and listened in vain
for the shrill baby voices to call to one another
in their play.</p>

<p>“The wooden soldiers stood straight and
stiff at their guns at ‘Present arms!’ waiting
for the cry of ‘Attention!’ but no order was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
given&mdash;no sound of fife or drum disturbed
the silence.</p>

<p>“The Dutch-faced dollies sat in corners,
smiling so sweetly, waiting expectantly for
their little mothers to rock them to sleep, but
no lullabys came to their ears.</p>

<p>“The parents gazed at the various toys till
their eyes were dim with tears and one night
when the moon was big and round, and oh, so
silvery, the Mayor tossed sleeplessly on his
bed. Presently he arose, dressed, and crept
out into the cool sweet night. His wife
heard and followed.</p>

<p>“When they reached the street they found
it peopled with many parents, waiting for
they knew not what.</p>

<p>“The silvery light of the moon shed its
glow upon the mountain, and as they looked,
suddenly the portal opened wide, disclosing
an inside gate of golden fretwork.</p>

<p>“Silently and slowly the portal swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
back, and they whispered to one another,
‘Was that the great door that shut the children
in?’</p>

<p>“With bated breath they waited, and suddenly
sweet strains of music filled the air.</p>

<p>“‘The Pied Piper!’ cried the Mayor, with
upraised hand.</p>

<p>“Never had they heard such notes, as clear
and silvery as the moonbeams themselves.
Then came the sound of children’s voices,
singing as never children sang, and though
it was sweet it was so sad they could scarcely
bear to listen, but it seemed to beckon them
on.</p>

<p>“They hurried up the path taken by the
children, and as they neared the door the
words of the song amazed them, and drew
forth exclamations.</p>

<p>“‘Keep your promise and we can come
back!’ was the burden of the song, and the
Mayor cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Come! The Piper must be told we
are ready and eager to give him what we
owe.’</p>

<p>“He led the way, but alas! they found the
inside gate so small, only a child could enter.
They called many times, but the only
response was the sad little song of the children.</p>

<p>“‘They cannot hear us. What will we
do?’ cried one mother on her knees before
the gate, trying in vain to push her way
through.</p>

<p>“‘The lame boy, where is he?’ queried the
Mayor in anguished tones.</p>

<p>“‘Fast asleep in his bed,’ replied his
mother.</p>

<p>“‘Go quickly and bring him!’ cried the
Mayor. ‘No one knows how soon the Portal
may swing shut.’</p>

<div class="caption">“The beauty of the scene almost overwhelmed him”</div>
</div>

<p>“The father and mother hastened to the little
home and to the crib where the boy lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>sleeping sweetly, bathed in the glow of the
silvery light.</p>

<p>“‘Come,’ whispered the mother. ‘Come.’</p>

<p>“The boy opened his eyes, sprang into his
father’s arms, and they hastened again up
the mountain path.</p>

<p>“‘The door is open,’ he cried joyously.
‘Now I can have some one to play with!’</p>

<p>“‘I hope so,’ breathed the mother. ‘Go in
and find the Piper. Tell him we beg of him
to let us keep our promise. If he will only
give us back our children we will give him
all we have!’</p>

<p>“The little fellow limped through the
golden portal and could go no farther, for
the beauty of the scene almost overwhelmed
him.</p>

<p>“Such flowers! Such trees, whose waving
branches of tender green were filled with the
most beautifully coloured birds he ever saw.
Such shrubs, with glistening leaves flutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>ing
timidly in the gentle breeze. Here the
moon shone with a light that was never on
land or sea.</p>

<p>“The boy gazed in raptures at the marvellous
picture, then glanced keenly about
for the Piper.</p>

<p>“Presently he saw him standing beneath
an arched bower of twining roses, but so sad
did he seem the boy hesitated to approach
him.</p>

<p>“He took one step, then paused amazed.
What had happened? He took another.
Oh, joy of joys! He was lame no more!
He dropped his crutch and ran. Ran as he
had dreamed of running&mdash;just as other children
did. Ran straight to the Piper.</p>

<p>“As the Piper clasped him in his arms, a
heavenly smile lighted his face, and he cried:</p>

<p>“‘At last they have heard the song. You
can never know the joy you have brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
me this day. It was my anger that closed
the gate and when it clanged to I said,
“Never will I forgive them. Never.”
Ever since, the gate has been as though
frozen shut. I knew why, but I wouldn’t
forgive.</p>

<p>“‘I did my best to make the children
happy, but you see by their sad song, I failed.
Have you noticed them?’</p>

<p>“The boy looked and for the first time
really saw his playmates.</p>

<p>“‘What pretty clothes they have!’ he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, the boys are clad in green and silver
leaves. The girls’ gowns are of flowers.
Flowers such as grow only here. They may
have a fresh gown every day, or oftener.’</p>

<p>“‘Where are their homes?’ asked the boy.</p>

<p>“‘They live like the birds in the trees.
Look!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>“The boy gazed in wonder up into the tree
tops, to see many tiny bowers woven of vines
and flowers.</p>

<p>“‘Their beds are of rose petals, the wind
rocks them to sleep, and the birds carol their
lullaby. The humming birds hover over
them as they dream. They drink honey
with the bees. They eat luscious fruits such
as one dreams of but never sees. With all
of this they are not happy. They sigh for
their dolls and soldiers, and weep for their
parents.</p>

<p>“‘Lately I have felt my anger melting,
and last night I suddenly knew I had forgiven
all, and that instant the portal swung
open. Soon I heard voices, but I could not
move. Only a little child could break the
spell. I am so thankful you could not follow
with the others since only a child could
pass through the golden gate to bring the
message.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Oh!’ cried the boy in ecstasy. ‘See! I
can walk! I can run! I am so happy!’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the Piper, ‘I know. No one
could be lame here now that the gate is open.
This is the land of harmony; but tell me,
boy, why did you come? Do tell me they
sent you.’</p>

<p>“‘They did. They want to keep their
promise.’</p>

<p>“‘They do? Will they give me the
gold?’ he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes, they want to. They beg of you
to take it.’</p>

<p>“‘Then tell them when the mountain path
is paved with guilders I will bring the children.’</p>

<p>“The boy bounded away, but as he passed
the children he was at once swept into the
ring and in some mysterious way he also was
clad in a garb of silvery leaves, while on his
head was placed a crown of wondrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
beauty, a crown of flowers which breathed
forth a rare perfume.</p>

<p>“As they danced round and round, the
song was no longer sad but rang out like joyous
bells, filling the air with showers of
gladness, while the Piper piped, and the
birds twittered and trilled the gayest of
tunes.</p>

<p>“They danced nearer and nearer the portal,
and presently saw without, a sea of hungry
faces and many outstretched arms.</p>

<p>“The boy shook himself loose and ran
through the gate. With shining eyes he
cried:</p>

<p>“‘See! I can walk! I can run! And I
have more good news, but you must obey.
Bring the gold quickly and you will soon
have your children.’</p>

<p>“They rubbed their eyes and stared, then
turned and ran down the mountain. Ran
faster than the rats ever dreamed of running.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Soon they came trooping up again each carrying
a bag of gold.</p>

<p>“‘The Piper said when the path was paved
with gold he would bring the children.
Quick! I will help!’ cried the boy.</p>

<p>“You should have seen them dropping the
gold pieces in place, and in a twinkling the
bags were empty and the road was one glittering
ribbon.</p>

<p>“The boy ran through the portal to the
Piper, crying: ‘It is finished; come.’</p>

<p>“The Piper hurried to the entrance, looked
down the shining path, paused, and waited.
The silence was tense, while all gazed into
his face wonderingly.</p>

<p>“‘The road is not finished,’ he said gently.
‘Look for yourselves. Some one has kept
back gold that is still due. We will wait.’</p>

<p>“The Mayor flushed and knelt at his feet.
‘It was I. I couldn’t give quite all. Forgive
me and I will bring more than enough.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>“He strode down the path, soon to return
carrying a leathern bag which clanked as he
walked. At the feet of the Piper he shook
out the golden circlets, which seemed bewitched
as one after another rolled toward
the empty spaces, where they spun round and
round like so many golden tops, and finally
settled into place. Those remaining piled
themselves about the Piper’s feet.</p>

<p>“The onlookers gazed in astonishment till
suddenly they heard heavenly music. At
once they stood either side of the golden
pathway, watching the Piper followed by
the children.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“‘All the little boys and girls,</div>
<div class="line">With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,</div>
<div class="line">Tripping and skipping ran merrily after</div>
<div class="line">The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“On and on they went, their tiny feet
treading silently the golden ribbon.</p>

<p>“The parents, with tears of joy streaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
o’er their faces, followed, enraptured with
the magic notes.</p>

<p>“Where the gleaming pathway ended the
Piper paused, the parents embraced their little
ones, then knelt at the feet of the Piper.</p>

<p>“‘Arise!’ he cried in beseeching tones. ‘I,
too, am guilty. We have both made
amends. Let us forget all wrongdoing and
be happy. You have emptied your coffers
but you are richer than ever.</p>

<p>“‘I do not want the gold. Let it lie a glittering
pathway to the land of joy, where the
children may dance and play to their hearts’
content.</p>

<p>“‘As long as we do right the Golden Portal
will never close. Farewell.’</p>

<p>“With these words he turned and walked
toward the mountain door. The parents
hurried to their homes, to find the boys ordering
out the wooden soldiers, and the dolls
drowsily smiling into mother eyes and listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>ing
to the far-away lullaby of the dear Pied
Piper.”</p>

<p>As the Story Elf finished she again vanished,
and during the silence that followed
the dolls thought they still heard the Piper’s
far away lullaby.</p>

<p>As it died away Allspice cried:</p>

<p>“How lovely to bring the children home
again. I’m glad she told us about it, for I
always felt sorry for the parents and the dear
little lame boy all alone.</p>

<p>“I hope we can have her come again.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we may, but now we must go on
with <i>our</i> stories.</p>

<p>“You know an old poem tells us little girls
are made of sugar and spice and all things
nice. Therefore, since Sugar is classed so
closely with Spice, we might let that sweet
lady talk to us for a while.”</p>
<hr />
<h2>MRS. SUGAR DOLL’S TALE</h2>

<p>The fat Sugar Lady now came forward,
and with a quick jerk of her skirts, showing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>her slippered feet, made an old-fashioned
courtesy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">“Sometimes it is gingerbread, or maybe plump brown
cookies”</div>
</div>

<p>“Isn’t she dear!” cried one and another, as
they gazed admiringly at the quaint figure
all dressed in white, which sparkled like
frost on the window pane. Dainty bunches
of rosebuds adorned her bonnet, and altogether
she was a sweet picture.</p>

<p>“My dears,” she cried, well aware of the
admiration she excited.</p>

<p>“I know I am sweet as well as you do, but
lest I become over-proud I will show you my
real self growing, which really isn’t anything
to look at.”</p>

<p>As she talked she untied her bonnet strings
and untwisted one of the curls that bobbed
about her snowy neck. The audience was
startled to hear a squeak like the dying gasp
of a rubber balloon.</p>

<p>As the squeak lingeringly died away,
Sugar grew thinner and taller, and presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
there she was turned into a long yellow sugar
cane.</p>

<p>A shout of laughter greeted this transformation,
as Sugar Cane made an elaborate
bow, beaming upon them as though delighted
to see them.</p>

<p>“Allow me to make you acquainted with
Mrs. Sugar’s better half,” he said.</p>

<p>“Butter half, you mean,” shouted Vinegar.</p>

<p>“Throw in a little flour and a few eggs and
we’ll have a birthday cake.”</p>

<p>“Which I would be delighted to do had I
those useful ingredients.”</p>

<p>“Ingredients?” said Cinnamon, thinking
hard. “Will Little Salt, who is now peeping
in the dictionary again, kindly let us
know the meaning of that word?”</p>

<p>“It means a part of something,” replied
Salt, much dismayed that she had again been
caught studying the big book when she
should have been listening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, a part of something; sugar, eggs and
flour are a part of the cake. Now let us hear
about this queer tall yellow stick.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Sir. I come from a wild plant
from India, Mexico, South America, and
most tropical countries. They are here, and
here, and here, and here,” and in the twinkling
of an eye he had walked about the
globe and left his footprint in each place.</p>

<p>“I am also found in the red beet and yellow
carrot. Perhaps it will be hard to believe,
but this yellow cane, which is as sweet
as honey, is placed between two large
hard rollers until all the juice is squeezed
out.</p>

<p>“This juice is boiled down, and when thick
is poured off.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, tut,” gurgled the Molasses Jug;
“don’t step on my toes.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” laughed Sugar Cane.
“I’m not going to tell any more of your story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
I had to tell that much to get at what settles
to the bottom, which is my sweet wife.</p>

<p>“It is first brown sugar. That is purified
by filtration, and when clear white takes the
various names of loaf sugar, lump sugar, and
refined sugar, according to the degree of
purification.</p>

<p>“Refined sugar is the pulverised confectioners’
sugar and is used in candies.</p>

<p>“Granulated sugar is made by stirring
while the strong syrup crystallises and forms
small grains or crystals.</p>

<p>“While I know I am not very pretty, yet
the children in the warm countries love me
dearly. They clamour for a piece of sugar
cane to suck, just as the children here beg for
candy sticks. Some of the poor little ones
have nothing to eat all day long but a stick
of sugar cane, and nowhere to sleep but on
a door step. They run around in bare feet
and with scarcely any clothes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>“Here! Here!” came the smothered
tones of Mrs. Sugar. “You have told the
whole story. I think you shouldn’t wind up
by making everybody weep. Blow yourself
up and let me come forth once more, please.”</p>

<p>Then Sugar Cane began to dwindle as a
gust of wind blew through his pipes.
Shorter and fatter he grew, till behold, there
was dear Mrs. Sugar, smiling down at them
as she again tied her bonnet strings.</p>

<p>“I never did see such a man. So dismal as
he grows sometimes. What if the children
do only have sugar cane all day. It’s good
and makes them fat, and a jollier lot I never
saw. They love to go barefooted; and as for
clothes, who wants any where the weather is
boiling hot all the time?</p>

<p>“Don’t waste any tears on him any of you.
Let’s hear from Molasses. She will send
your tears flying as high as a kite.”</p>

<p>At this summons the Molasses Jug now ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>peared.
Her gown was a beautiful shade
of golden brown, with touches of sunshiny
yellow here and there. She really wasn’t a
jug, but looked like one from the fact that
she kept her arm crooked up just like a jug
handle.</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE MOLASSES DOLL</h2>


<p>“Well,” she said gaily. “Mr. Sugar
pretty near told you my story, I stopped
him just in time. I come in just where the
juice from the sugar cane boils down thick.
That was my own splendid self that was
poured off.</p>

<p>“I love the time when I gurgle down into
a barrel, and fairly hug myself when that
barrel is in a grocery store waiting to be sold.
I always wonder what kind of a home I am
going to, and what will be done with me.</p>

<p>“I sit there in the dark, and presently the
spigot in the barrel is turned, and the thick
stream gurgles into jugs. The jugs are
placed in a grocery wagon. The driver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
whistles a merry tune, and away we go into
so many homes.</p>

<p>“I make so many good things, and it is such
fun guessing what I’m going to be in each
time. Sometimes it is gingerbread, or may
be plump brown cookies. Again, it is pudding
with fat plums swelling up inside.</p>

<p>“Once a grand thing happened. It was
the day before Christmas. The driver was
hurrying the horse along at the very edge of
town.</p>

<p>“Suddenly something startled the horse,
and he ran away. The wagon overturned.
Everything was thrown about in the snow.
My jug broke and I began to run out all
over. I had good company though, for popcorn,
cranberries, and all sorts of things were
scattered about me.</p>

<p>“The grocery boy gathered up most of the
stuff and away he went. I was hopeless, and
thought what a miserable Christmas I was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
have. No good to anybody. Suddenly I
pricked up my ears. Children were crying,
and I heard one say:</p>

<p>“‘Can’t have any Christmas at all. Not a
speck of anything. No money to buy anything
with!’</p>

<p>“A group of them were trudging through
the snow from school. When they saw me
one said: ‘What’s that?’</p>

<p>“Wasn’t I glad I was molasses. Most
anything else would have been of no use at
such a time. I could hardly keep still when
I saw one after another poke a finger into the
brown mass and taste.</p>

<p>“‘Molasses!’ they cried in one breath.</p>

<p>“With a whoop of delight they ran into a
nearby home, and came back with a pail and
cups. The snow had a glassy crust and I
hadn’t sunken in at all. So all they had to
do was to scoop, and there I was. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
scooped and scraped till they had a good pail
full.</p>

<p>“I saw a few ears of popcorn that had
lodged down in a little hollow, so I let a
small stream run after them. The children
spied them, and such a shout went up as you
never heard! Luckily the snow was fresh
fallen and clean, so they really had made
quite a find.</p>

<p>“We were hurried into the house, and
when the mother and father came home from
their work, looking sad enough because they
could not give the children any Christmas,
they were greeted with the cries of ‘Merry
Christmas! Merry Christmas!’</p>

<p>“It would have done your hearts good to
have seen that candy pull, and the popcorn
balls were the finest ever made. They had a
perfectly good Christmas that didn’t cost a
cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>“So I think molasses is quite important
in this world even if it is cheap.”</p>

<p>Molasses sat down amid a round of applause.</p>

<p>“What a nice story! I wish some one
would tell another,” murmured little Allspice,
whose earnest blue eyes and clasped
hands showed how she had loved the story.</p>

<p>“A splendid idea! The night is slowly
passing; perhaps some of us may think up
some interesting stories; incidents we have
seen in our various home lands.</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE VINEGAR KING</h2>


<p>“Now let’s hear from the Vinegar King.
We have had much sweet, perhaps we would
like a little sour for a change.”</p>

<p>His Majesty was tall and thin, dressed in
velvet knee breeches and fancy coat with silver
trimmings. His cockade hat looked as
though he really did belong to royalty, but
so sour an expression did he wear you could
tell at once that he stood for nothing sweet.</p>

<div class="caption">“Suddenly something startled the horse, and he ran away”</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen: I am happy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Happy&mdash;you?” queried the audience in
gales of laughter.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to say I was happy. I
started to say I am happy to inform you that
in wine countries I come from fermented
poor wines, elsewhere from malt or apple
cider.”</p>

<p>With that he sat down.</p>

<p>“Here! Here! Is that all you have to
tell us?” cried Cinnamon Stick.</p>

<p>“All! It is much more than Molasses had
to say.”</p>

<p>“You have talked for twenty seconds.
Molasses entertained us for many minutes!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Chairman, but if you simmer
down what Molasses told you of her history,
it will take three seconds by the clock to say
it. It was this: ‘I am the juice from the sugar
cane boiled down and gurgled into a barrel!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>’”</p>

<p>Vinegar tried so hard to imitate Molasses,
even to the sweet expression, he sat down
amid roars of laughter.</p>

<p>Molasses now hopped up in the greatest
haste, crying:</p>

<p>“So I did gurgle into a barrel, and into a
jug, too. It was all there was to tell. Sugar
Cane had to tell the beginning of me because
we came from the same thing. It was
why I told the story, and dear knows it was
a sweet story.”</p>

<p>“The gentleman with silver trimmed knee
breeches will kindly tell us something further
of himself,” said Cinnamon Stick in
bland tones. “What are you good for?”</p>

<p>“I am used for soothing remedies in the
pharmacies.”</p>

<p>“Soothing!” laughed Salt and Pepper.
“I hope you have your picture on the outside
of the bottles.”</p>

<p>“I do. They especially asked for it. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
good for many things besides medicine.
Sour pickles could never be made without
me, and as for peach pickles, you might have
all the cloves and cinnamon in the world in
them, would they be at all if it were not
for me? As for my looks, I can’t help them.
We all have to look like we are, and even
though I look and seem sour, at heart I am
sweet because really I have to have sugar to
make the mother.”</p>

<p>“Mother!” cried bashful Allspice. “Have
you really a dear mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, not that kind of a mother.
It is just some thick stringy stuff that grows
in Vinegar as it ferments and makes it ferment
quicker. It is just called mother.</p>

<p>“That is all I know about me. Thank you
for your kind attention.”</p>

<p>“You are very welcome,” said Cinnamon
Stick. “You really did very well after
all.</p>

<h2>TALE OF THE CITRON DOLL</h2>


<p>“Now let’s hear from Miss Citron. She
sounds very sweet and good.”</p>

<p>“And I am sweet and good, too,” said the
doll with the large green head, gorgeously
gowned in purple.</p>

<p>“I grow in Spain.” Here she sat down on
the top of the globe and rolled over and over
till she reached that spot where she was to be
found, then rose and continued:</p>

<p>“My tree has an upright smooth trunk with
a branchy head rising from five to fifteen
feet, adorned with large oval spear-shaped
leaves. See, my hat is made of one. Isn’t it
<i>chic</i>?” and she placed the odd hat on her
head and paraded about for a moment.</p>

<p>“Don’t mistake me for a Pathé Moving
Picture fashion show, please, for I never
aspired to anything higher than fruit cake
and pastries.</p>

<p>“My fruit is different from the lemon in
that it has no knob at the top and the rind is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
much thicker. My tree has purple blossoms
that are white inside. The seeds of the fruit
are bitter. After they are taken out I am cut
in half and dried in sugar and make a delicious
confection.</p>

<p>“I am sorry my story is short, but that is
really all there is to tell.”</p>

<p>“Very good, indeed, and now we will hear
from the ballet girls, Orange and Lemon,
who seem in a flutter to tell their tales,” announced
Mr. Cinnamon Stick.</p>

<p>The Orange and Lemon Dolls now came
forward, and after a sweeping bow danced
like fairies about the hearth, their orange
and yellow skirts fluffing about their tiny
feet.</p>

<p>“Opera glasses! Opera glasses!” shouted
one.</p>

<p>“All music and words of the opera here,”
sang another.</p>

<p>“Standing room only,” cried another.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<h2>TALES OF THE ORANGE AND LEMON DOLLS</h2>


<p>Mr. Cinnamon Stick bade them be quiet,
and Orange began her story.</p>

<p>“We come from about the same parts of
the world; watch and you will see where.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the audience followed the pair
as they heeled and toed over the globe,
touching daintily Italy, Spain, Portugal,
Florida, and California.</p>

<p>“The California orange is liked best because
it has no seeds. It is a deep orange
colour with a thick skin.</p>

<p>“The Florida orange is a shade lighter and
has a thinner skin.</p>

<p>“We also grow in Mexico&mdash;here&mdash;but the
Mexican orange cannot be shipped because
it will not keep. It is sweet and delicious,
however, and much loved by the natives.</p>

<p>“One wonderful thing about the orange
tree is that at the same time, on the same
tree, you will find the buds, blossoms, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
green and ripe fruit, because they grow
slowly. Also the grape fruit is sometimes
grafted on our trees. There are oranges that
will hang on the trees for two years, so they
can be picked at any time, which is most convenient.</p>

<p>“The trees stand about twenty-three feet
apart and must not be chilled for it hurts the
buds. When a cold snap comes, the owners
build fires here and there in the orange
groves and keep them all snug and warm.
They must watch the weather reports very
closely, as in a short time the cold might ruin
the orange crop.</p>

<p>“One thousand oranges have been taken
from one tree. When the tree is no longer
fruitful, its hard, fine-grained, yellowish
wood is valued for inlaid work.</p>

<p>“The orange was first found in India, then
spread to Western Asia, Spain, Italy, and is
now grown in all tropical lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Lemon may tell us about herself, as
that is all I know.”</p>

<p>“I also am from Spain, and all those countries
we touched,” said the Lemon Doll.</p>

<p>“I grew on a tree with three thousand in
the family.</p>

<p>“We are picked green because then we
keep better and the skins are thinner. If we
are left in our tree house until grown to full
size our skins are thick, and we are sent to
England, where we are sugared and dried
and named sugared lemon peel.</p>

<p>“We don’t sound like much, but when you
see us in heaps and piles in the groceries, and
see the lot of money we bring in to the owners,
you find we are quite worth while, for
we are shipped all over the world, and wherever
you are you will usually find us on the
table, if you find no other fruit.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, my dears. You are both
a most important food, and we are glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
we met up with you,” cried Cinnamon
Stick.</p>

<p>“And now <i>I’m</i> going to wish again for the
Story Sprite. I want a Christmas story.”</p>

<p>“Oh, joy!” exclaimed the audience, rapturously
beaming upon the Story Sprite, who
sprang from the back log at the magic word
“wish,” singing gaily:</p>

<p>“And a Christmas story you shall have.
Here is my favourite one. It is called</p>



<hr />
<h2>ANNA BELLE’S CHRISTMAS EVE.</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Anna Belle</span> had had a very exciting day,
and now, curled up on the window seat, her
head pillowed on downy cushions, she sat
watching the sleighs flying by.</p>

<p>“It was a glorious night. The moon shed
its silvery glow on the busy scene, and Anna
Belle drowsily noted the people passing with
arms filled and pockets bulging.</p>

<p>“‘I wish I could see what’s in those pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>ages,’
she murmured. ‘I think Christmas is
queer anyhow.’</p>

<p>“‘Why?’ came in tinkling tones to her
ears.</p>

<p>“Anna Belle jumped, for there beside her
was a beautiful fairy, holding on high a silver
wand, on the end of which gleamed a
star.</p>

<p>“‘Why?’ persisted the fairy creature, determined
to have an explanation of such a
statement.</p>

<p>“‘Well, I ask for a lot of things I never
get, and I get a lot of things I don’t want.’</p>

<p>“‘You do?’ said the Fairy inquiringly.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, every year I do. In the attic are
boxes and boxes of things I didn’t care at all
for. Somehow I’m never very happy at
Christmas time.’</p>

<p>“‘Are you <i>giving</i> any presents this year?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes, Papa always gives me money
to buy them, but I didn’t spend it all. I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
asked for a bracelet, and if I don’t get it
I’m going to buy one with what I have
left.’</p>

<p>“The fairy glanced about the beautiful
room, where seemed to be everything to make
one happy, then she gently asked:</p>

<p>“‘Are the gifts you bought gifts you feel
sure are wanted by those who will receive
them?’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle flushed as she tossed her curls
and replied:</p>

<p>“‘Perhaps not. Papa always says, “You
can’t get something for nothing,” and you
see I didn’t want to spend all my money.’</p>

<p>“‘Did you have a happy time buying these
gifts?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, no. Do you think any one is very
happy at Christmas time?’</p>

<p>“‘That depends. Some are very, very
happy.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, I know. People with bushels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
gifts are, especially if they are really what
they want.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ laughed the Fairy. ‘I know people
who have scarcely any money to buy presents
and yet are having a lovely Christmas with
presents made out of nothing. People who
are as poor as crows, and yet are bubbling
over with joy this very night.’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle opened her eyes very wide at
this statement.</p>

<p>“‘Making a Christmas out of nothing, and
as poor as crows!’ she echoed. ‘Just how
poor is that? I’d like to see them.’</p>

<p>“‘You would? Come with me then,’ and
after a wave of the silvery wand Anna Belle
found herself floating along in mid air like
a bird.</p>

<p>“‘Oh!’ she cried. ‘What fun! I wish I
could always be a fairy!’</p>

<p>“‘If you wish it hard enough you may be.
Now follow me very closely for we aren’t the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>only fairies abroad Christmas Eve. The air
is full of them.’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle looked about her, and sure
enough, it was almost like June bug season.
She felt them whizzing past her, and at times
their whirring wings fairly brushed her
cheeks.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, how lovely it is!’ she exclaimed.
‘How different it all looks from above!’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, dear, everything looks different
from above. Do you see that wee brown
house far over in that meadow, all alone?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ replied Anna Belle; ‘are they poor
as crows?’</p>

<p>“‘Poorer, they haven’t even any feathers,’
laughed the Fairy, as they gently floated
down, down, till they could peer into a window
of the little house.</p>

<p>“A mother sat by a table sewing. Anna
Belle watched to see that she was making
dolls from bottles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>“She fashioned heads by placing a wad of
cotton in a piece of muslin. Giving the
cloth a twist, she had a perfect round ball
which she shaped and tied down over a cork.
On this she skilfully painted a face, then tied
a trim little bonnet about it, and behold,
there was a smiling bit of a creature awaiting
the next move.</p>

<p>“She then made petticoat, dress and coat,
and stood it in a corner while she made another.
As she worked she smiled so sweetly
the whole room seemed aglow.</p>

<p>“‘Come and see who will have these gifts,’
whispered the Fairy.</p>

<p>“Anna Belle followed and peeped in another
window. There she saw a number of
little children all snuggled up fast asleep.</p>

<p>“‘Look!’ whispered the Fairy, and pointed
to a stand where were a few gifts. A pin-cushion
made of bits of ribbon from a scrap
bag, and a workbox made from a cigar box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
This was a work of art indeed. Pockets had
been tacked inside, and on the bottom of the
box lay a spool of thread.</p>

<p>“‘Looks lonesome, doesn’t it?’ whispered
the Fairy.</p>

<p>“Anna Belle nodded as she thought of her
own beautiful workbox of carved ivory with
gold thimble and all sorts of beautiful
fittings.</p>

<p>“Then she remembered another laid away
in the attic, one of the things she didn’t
want.</p>

<p>“These two crude gifts were marked in
childish hand, ‘For Mother with much love.’</p>

<p>“‘Love is sticking out all over those
things,’ said the Fairy. ‘Come down and see
how she is getting on with her bottle family.’</p>

<p>“They went below, to find the dolls nearly
finished, and a fine ready-made family it was.</p>

<p>“Father, mother, children, and even a
weenty teenty pill bottle doll, dressed as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
baby in long clothes, was pinned to the
mother, the tiny head nestled close to the
spot where her heart should be.</p>

<p>“‘They are lovely!’ declared Anna Belle.</p>

<p>“‘They are, indeed, and they can do what
many of the finest dolls you buy cannot.
They can stand and you can have great fun
with them.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m going to make some,’ said Anna
Belle. ‘I think they are cute. What is
she doing now?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, don’t you see? Some one has
given her a branch from a Christmas tree.
She is fastening the dolls to it. Now she’s
poking the coals, she’s going to pop corn and
string it for the tree. That cost one penny.
She’s also going to make molasses candy.
See it bubbling in that kettle? Molasses is
very cheap and it will be the only candy they
will have, but they will be wild over it, just
because only at Christmas time they have it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Now come and I’ll show you crow number
two.’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle was loath to leave this interesting
window, but she obediently followed
on.</p>

<p>“‘Look in here,’ whispered the Fairy, as
they paused by another humble home.</p>

<p>“Anna Belle looked, to see an empty stocking
swinging from the mantel. On it was
pinned a paper, and Anna Belle read the
large printed words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Santa Claus&mdash;If you have enough things
to go round won’t you give my sister a music box
and a readin’ buck. She’s lame and can’t play like
me. You needn’t give me anything. I can hear
the music and read her’s.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Jamie.</span>”
</p></div>

<p>“Anna Belle’s eyes filled as she read, and
followed the Fairy to see two children fast
asleep, dreaming of what they hoped they
might find in the morning.</p>

<p>“‘They have no mother. The father isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
much good, but does his best to feed them.
In the morning those stockings will be as
empty as they are now.’</p>

<p>“‘Dear! Dear! Why doesn’t some one
know about it?’ asked Anna Belle tearfully.</p>

<p>“‘Some one does know now,’ replied the
Fairy with a wise nod as they floated on.</p>

<p>“‘I hope they’ll do something then,’ said
Anna Belle.</p>

<p>“‘I hope so,’ whispered the Fairy. ‘Look
in here,’ and Anna Belle peered in a window.</p>

<p>“Here a child of perhaps twelve or fourteen
was seated at a table, working busily.
Anna Belle watched to see her making paper
dolls. She cut them out, painted faces and
hair, then made a number of cunning dresses,
coats and hats, placed them in envelopes and
marked the outside.</p>

<p>“They watched till she had three ready,
then slipped them into the stockings, hanging
waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>“The love light in her eyes was sweet to
behold and as she stood over the lamp to put
it out, Anna Belle noticed the rare delicate
beauty of her face.</p>

<p>“When all was dark the Fairy moved on.</p>

<p>“‘She didn’t even hang up her own stocking,’
said Anna Belle.</p>

<p>“‘No one to fill it. She mothers those
three little ones, and it’s all she can do to
make things go, but did you ever see any
one look happier? See the card on this door
knob?’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle paused to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Santa&mdash;Please bring me a sleeping doll.
Even if you can’t spare one, if you would just let
me hold one a moment and sing it to sleep once I
will be glad. I am a good girl.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Elsie.</span>”<br />
</p></div>

<p>“‘See her! Isn’t she dear?’ cried Anna
Belle, as she peeped in the window to see a
beautiful plump little girl fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>“‘She looks like a sleeping doll herself.
Will she get the doll, do you think?’</p>

<p>“‘I hope so. It all depends,’ said the
Fairy.</p>

<p>“They floated along for some time, and
presently went down to hover over some children
looking in the window of a toy store.</p>

<p>“Wistful little faces they had, and their
clothes told Anna Belle they must get their
fun out of just looking.</p>

<p>“Farther on in front of the candy store
huddled a shabby crowd, gazing at the sparkling
goodies.</p>

<p>“‘Come away, please, I don’t want to see
any more. Surely they aren’t happy,’ cried
Anna Belle.</p>

<p>“‘They are as happy as they can be. Each
one of them had a penny in a tightly closed
fist, wondering what to buy to take home
and put in an empty stocking.</p>

<p>“‘Let’s stop here a moment,’ whispered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Fairy, poising on the top of a Christmas tree
in front of a big store.</p>

<p>“Anna Belle, standing beside her, noticed
that as she held on high her wand the star
shone out so bright and beautiful the people
below paused and gazed in wonder. The
happy faces beamed even brighter and the
unhappy ones changed instantly.</p>

<p>“‘What does it mean?’ whispered one and
another, while one little girl cried:</p>

<p>“‘Why, Mother, it’s <i>the</i> Star. Don’t you
know?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ whispered the mother, clasping
more closely the little hand and passing on.</p>

<p>“‘What made the cross ones look so glad,
and the happy ones look more so?’ asked
Anna Belle, as she watched the throngs below.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t you know really?’ asked the
Fairy.</p>

<p>“Anna Belle pondered a while, then looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
at the sky to see it thickly dotted with stars,
and saw that One shone more brightly than
any of the others. She then turned to look
at the star on the end of the wand, but behold,
it had vanished.</p>

<p>“‘Where is it?’ she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“‘It came down and did its work and then
went back where it belongs,’ replied the
Fairy with a roguish twinkle, and Anna
Belle stared for a moment at the splendid
bright star, then said softly:</p>

<p>“‘I understand it now, and why it could
do it, but I had forgotten what Christmas
really means.</p>

<p>“‘For a long time it has seemed to mean
only things. Gifts, and not only gifts, but
certain kinds of gifts.</p>

<p>“‘Oh!’ she said wistfully, ‘I wish I could
do something to help. Was that what you
meant when you kept saying, “That depends”?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>“‘That was just what I meant. Now you
have seen the Star, and I know all will be
well.’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle seemed busily thinking, and
the Fairy waited.</p>

<p>“‘The-attic is full of presents I didn’t
want, and I have a lot of money I was going
to use for the bracelet.’</p>

<p>“‘<i>If</i> you didn’t get it,’ laughed the Fairy.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t want it now. I’d rather use it
for these poor little children. Elsie must
have a doll. I have one, and a music box,
and many “Readin’” books with pictures,
but how can we get them to the
places?’</p>

<p>“‘Fairies are stronger than you think. I
will summon my helpers.’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle then heard a sound as of wind
whistling around the corners. In a moment
there appeared fairies without number.
Such silvery sprites they were Anna Belle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
longed to take one to her heart and keep for
ever and ever.</p>

<p>“‘Come!’ cried the Fairy, who seemed to
be the leader.</p>

<p>“As she floated away all followed, and
Anna Belle found they were headed straight
for her own home and the attic.</p>

<p>“As she wondered how they would get in,
she found herself flying easily through the
tiny bird window high up in the tower.</p>

<p>“‘How lovely!’ she cried. ‘I never knew
it was for fairies!’</p>

<p>“‘Show what we are to take,’ cried the
Fairy. ‘We must hurry.’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle pointed out a music box,
books, dishes, balls, skates. In fact, toys of
every description. Then she opened one
large box to find a beautiful doll with eyes
closed in slumber. ‘For Elsie,’ she whispered,
and watched to see each fairy gather
up a gift and press close to its shining bosom.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="500" height="711" alt="'Show what we are to take,' cried the Fairy. 'We must
hurry'" />
<div class="caption">“‘Show what we are to take,’ cried the Fairy. ‘We must
hurry’”</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Are we really going to take them?’ she
asked.</p>

<p>“‘We wouldn’t miss the joy of it for anything,’
replied her fairy friend.</p>

<p>“They floated away; Anna Belle holding
to her heart the sleeping doll. She tried to
recall why she hadn’t wanted it, for it was
so pretty. Then she flushed, for she remembered
that she had been cross over this very
doll because she had asked for a brown-eyed
doll and this one had blue eyes!</p>

<p>“‘I didn’t deserve any doll, nor anything,’
she said. ‘I didn’t know I was so bad.’</p>

<p>“‘Forget it!’ laughed the Fairy. ‘We
can’t afford to be thinking over our wrong-doings.
If we have started on the right track
we will have enough to do to keep within
it.</p>

<p>“‘Here is the candy store. I know you
want some. Give me your money; I’ll get it
for you. I know the man well. He’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
double what he gives me, for he well knows
what I’ll do with it.’</p>

<p>“In some mysterious way Anna Belle
found in a moment each one was carrying a
basket of bonbons on a tiny arm as they
floated on.</p>

<p>“‘Here is Elsie,’ whispered the Fairy presently.</p>

<p>“Anna Belle placed the doll in Elsie’s
arms, then filled the stockings with other toys
and sweets. In the toe she placed a shining
gold piece.</p>

<p>“The music box, books, and other toys were
left in the home of the lame child; also a gold
piece shone in the toe of each stocking hanging
there.</p>

<p>“The paper doll girl was generously remembered,
and the bottle dolls smiled
gratefully at the load of gifts left at their
feet.</p>

<p>“Anna Belle’s eyes shone as she thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the joy this Christmas was to bring to so
many hearts.</p>

<p>“‘How many?’ asked the Fairy, who
seemed to know what she was thinking.</p>

<p>“Anna Belle pondered as they floated
homeward. Presently she cried: ‘Why,
just think, it’s twenty-four!’</p>

<p>“‘Only twenty-four? I counted twenty-five.’</p>

<p>“Again Anna Belle went over them, then
said: ‘I can’t remember the odd one.’</p>

<p>“The Fairy sent forth a bubbling, rippling
laugh, which puzzled Anna Belle for a moment,
then she twinkled and cried:</p>

<p>“‘Why, I’m the odd one. I never was so
happy. When did it begin? Oh, I know; it
was when I saw the Star, wasn’t it?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, indeed,’ replied the Fairy, ‘and not
only when you saw the Star, but when you
remembered the meaning of it.</p>

<p>“‘The love that came in with the Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Child and His spirit of loving and giving,
not only of gifts but of Himself, has come
down with the ages, and will go on and
on.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m so glad I found it out. I really
don’t care now whether I get the bracelet, or
not,’ declared Anna Belle, as they floated
into her bedroom window.</p>

<p>“‘No, but see!’ and the Fairy pointed with
her wand, on the end of which Anna Belle
again saw the shining Star sending a glow
of light over her dresser, and there lying on
its velvet bed she beheld a beautiful circlet
of dull gold.</p>

<p>“Much excited, she whispered: ‘Is it
plain? I really wanted it jewelled.’ Then
she laughed and added: ‘No, I don’t care
how it is. Just so it’s a bracelet, for I’m
afraid I do kind of want it. Is it wrong to
want it? If it is, I’ll try till I don’t.’</p>

<p>The Fairy gently caressed her, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
touched the golden circlet with her wand.</p>

<p>“‘No, it isn’t wrong to want it now that
you remember the true meaning of Christmas,
and want to keep it with the true Christmas
spirit. See!’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle looked to see a starry jewel
embedded in the gold, then she noticed the
Star had vanished from the wand.</p>

<p>“She looked quickly out at the sky, where
the steady light of the Star shone straight
into her eyes.</p>

<p>“‘I’m glad you didn’t take that Star,’ she
whispered. ‘We couldn’t get along without
it.’</p>

<p>“‘My, no. I couldn’t take that Star.
That’s the Star of Bethlehem, you know.
This is just a weenty teenty shadow of that
Star, that’s why it isn’t quite so bright.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s bright enough for me, and means
a lot. How can I ever thank you for this
night’s work?’ asked Anna Belle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Never again lose sight of the Star and
I will be more than repaid. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>“Anna Belle watched her out of sight, then
turned and&mdash;dear me! she opened her eyes;
the sleighs were still flying past, for she
could hear the bells ringing so merrily.</p>

<p>“‘How much sweeter they sound,’ she
cried. ‘They seem to be saying, “Merry
Christmas! Merry Christmas!” I wonder
why I didn’t notice it before.’</p>

<p>“She ran down-stairs to find Mother busily
wrapping packages. She looked at Anna
Belle and cried:</p>

<p>“‘Why, child, what makes your eyes so
bright, and why do you look so glad? I
heard you saying all sorts of things as you
slept.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Mother! If you only knew,’ and
thereupon she told the whole story of her
dream, omitting the part about the bracelet.
When she had finished she drew her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to the window, where together they gazed at
the Star.</p>

<p>“Mother’s eyes were full of tears, as she
said gently, ‘Ring the bell, dear.’</p>

<p>“The maid appeared, and Mother asked
that John bring out the double sleigh at
once, adding:</p>

<p>“‘Then come to me; bring Annie also.
We have work to do.’</p>

<p>“Wonderingly the maids followed to the
attic and brought down many boxes lying
there, waiting for they knew not what.</p>

<p>“‘Help me to tie them up separately in
white tissue paper. Use the prettiest ribbons.’</p>

<p>“They worked busily, and soon a more
Christmasy lot of bundles it would be hard to
find.</p>

<p>“They placed them in baskets, together
with warm clothes, beautiful dresses of Anna
Belle’s that were hardly worn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>“Presently Anna Belle, Mother, and the
baskets were packed in the big sleigh, dashing
down the street.</p>

<p>“One stop they made, at the candy store,
then on they went.</p>

<p>“‘Do you think you can find Elsie, and the
little lame girl, and the house where the bottle
dolls are?’</p>

<p>“‘I’m sure I can,’ replied Mother. ‘I happen
to know them all.’</p>

<p>“And find them they did, and many others
who were not in the dream.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Mother! isn’t it sweet to do?’ cried
Anna Belle, her bright eyes shining up at the
Star.</p>

<p>“‘It is, indeed, dear. I’m very glad you
had the dream, for I fear I also was forgetting
the real meaning of Christmas and almost
entirely losing sight of the Star.’</p>

<p>“She held the child close till the joy ride
was over, then kissed her, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>“‘I don’t know when I have been so
happy!’</p>

<p>“‘Nor I, Mother dear; and we owe it all
to the Good Fairy.’</p>

<p>“‘We do, indeed. May she never cease to
wave her starry wand. Good night, my
child, good night.’</p>

<p>“Soon Anna Belle slept, and as she slept
the starlight beamed on her sweet face, and
presently it shone also on a golden circlet lying
on its velvet pillow on the dresser.</p>

<p>“The dream seemed really coming true, for
there embedded in the gold gleamed a starry
jewel.</p>

<p>“When Anna Belle found it the next
morning, she ran to Mother’s room crying
earnestly:</p>

<p>“‘Mother, <i>do</i> you think the Fairy left
it?’</p>

<p>“‘No doubt,’ replied Mother with twinkling
eyes, ‘at least she must have touched it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
with her wand, for you see she has left her
messenger:</p>

<p>
“‘and the Star is shining.’”<br />
</p>

<p>The story ended, the Sprite vanished, and
in her place the light of a beautiful star shed
a halo about the little heads.</p>

<p>The tiny creatures sat spellbound, dreaming
again with Anna Belle, till they were
suddenly awakened by Cinnamon Stick who
cried:</p>

<p>“Well! Well! Wasn’t that a grand
Christmas story! I almost felt as though we
too were flying fairies playing Santa Claus,
but since we are just plain mince pie elves
playing school we better go on with our
game.</p>
<hr />
<h2>TALES OF THE SALT AND PEPPER TWINS</h2>

<p>“Now I am most anxious to hear from the
black and white pair of twins. Allow me to
introduce Salt and Pepper, both of whom
seem very necessary in this world of ours.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="500" height="722" alt="I am used very extensively as an April Fool" />
<div class="caption">“I am used very extensively as an April Fool”</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>Salt and Pepper now teetered forward. A
cute little pair, indeed. Salt, all robed
in frosty white, first began, and saucily
cried out her big name of Sodium Chloride.</p>

<p>“I haven’t much to say except that I look
so like sugar you can hardly tell which is
which. For that reason I am used very extensively
as an April Fool and am most
popular on that day.</p>

<p>“I come principally from the United
States, of which you all know without my
showing you; from Michigan, New York,
Ohio, Louisiana, West Virginia, California,
Kansas, and Utah.</p>

<p>“Michigan and New York gave in 1888
about three quarters of all the salt produced
in the United States.</p>

<p>“The salt of California is made by evaporation
of sea water. That of Utah from
water of Great Salt Lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>“That found in Louisiana and Kansas
comes by mining rock salt.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a riddle. What is it that
has to be in most everything we eat, or else
it isn’t good? I’ll answer because you
couldn’t possibly guess. It’s salt.</p>

<p>“You could hardly enjoy a meal without
me. What would a table be without the salt
box? And as for birthday parties, they just
couldn’t have them if I vanished from the
earth.”</p>

<p>“‘Tisn’t true,” cried Orange. “A party I
was at once was almost ruined because of
you. You worked into the ice cream, and
what’s a party without ice cream? No one
could eat it and the children cried!”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Salt. “I forgot to tell
you that while a little of me is most necessary,
too much of a good thing is worse than
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>“Now my twin brother will tell you of
himself.”</p>

<p>Black Pepper, dressed in a black velvet
suit and cap, politely bowed as he removed
his hat.</p>

<p>“Kechoo! Kechoo!” sneezed the audience.</p>

<p>“Put your cap on quickly,” whispered
Salt; “don’t you see you are making them
sneeze?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pardon me!” apologised Pepper. “I
didn’t think that politeness would cause such
distress. My story is very short.</p>

<p>“I come from all damp tropical countries,
and my tree is a joy to behold, when hanging
full of scarlet berries against the background
of green leaves. The spikes are gathered
when the berries begin to turn red. The berries
are rubbed off and dried and form then
the ordinary black pepper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>“The white pepper consists of the seeds
of the same fruit allowed to ripen and deprived
of their pulp. The white pepper
finds its largest market in China, which is
right here.</p>

<p>“There is a plant of the genus Capsicum.
From those pods come Cayenne or red pepper.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” he cried, with a funny quick
bow.</p>

<p>“Your stories are short, but you are both
about as necessary an article of food as I
know of,” said Mr. Cinnamon Stick, “and
now let us hear from this apple-cheeked
maid, all about her lovely fruit, the Apple.”</p>

<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE APPLE DOLL</h2>

<p>The Apple-faced Doll tripped forward in
the greatest of haste.</p>

<p>“I shall sit while I talk,” she said, seating
herself and smoothing out her snowy apron.
“I have a long story to tell which, I am sure,
you will all love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>“A story! A story!” rippled through the
audience, as the dolls crept close to the
speaker, and with clasped hands awaited this
treat.</p>

<p>Little Allspice placed herself in the rosy-cheeked
maiden’s lap, and a pretty picture it
was to see her upturned face in the golden
gleam of the dancing flames.</p>

<p>“Well,” began the maid with the jolly
smile, “the apple is to be found most everywhere
in mild climates. It first came from
Avella, a town in Campania, right there.”
As she spoke she pointed with a long pointer
standing near by, to a place in Italy.</p>

<p>“It was introduced into America from England
in 1629 by the Governor of Massachusetts
Bay.</p>

<p>“There are many varieties of apples, sweet
and sour, hard and soft, eating and cooking
apples.</p>

<p>“The cider in the mincemeat is made from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the juice of the apples. They are crushed
in a cider mill and the juice is strained.
Some apples would delight a child’s heart
with their beautiful colours of gold and crimson,
and some grow to an enormous size.</p>



<hr />
<h2>THE STORY OF JOHNNY APPLESEED</h2>


<p>“And now for the story:</p>

<p>“Once there was a man who was very,
very poor. He had been a farmer and no
one raised such fine crops as did he. By and
by, in some way, he lost his farm and was
left all alone.</p>

<p>“He had always wanted to do some grand
thing, something that would make many
people happy, but what could he do? He
had no money. All he had was a small
boat.</p>

<p>“As he trudged along one day he saw some
old sacks lying under a tree. As he looked
at them he had a splendid thought. A
thought that seemed to have wings and came
flying from far away. Oh, it was a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
thought, and seemed to be singing a little
song in his heart as he picked up the sacks
and placed them in his boat, jumped in himself
and floated away.</p>

<p>“As he rowed down the stream the man
watched the shore with keen eyes. When he
saw an apple orchard he rowed to land, tied
his boat, hastened to the homes near the orchards
and asked for work.</p>

<p>“He cut wood, carried water, and did all
sorts of odd chores. In payment for this
work he asked for food, and what else do you
suppose?</p>

<p>“The people were so surprised at what he
asked for they could hardly believe him.
He asked that he might have the seeds from
the apples on the ground under the trees&mdash;only
the seeds.</p>

<p>“Of course they gladly gave him such a
simple thing, and as he cut the fruit the
neighbour children swarmed about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>“From one place to another he went, always
adding to his store of seeds.</p>

<p>“Some generous farmers gave him also cuttings
of peach, pear, and plum trees, and
grape vines.</p>

<p>“Day after day, day after day, he cut up
the fruit, while the children sat at his feet
and listened to thrilling tales of what he had
seen in his travels. Of the Indians with
their gay blankets and feathers, of their
camps where they lived in the forests.</p>

<p>“Of their dances and war paint; their
many coloured, beaded necklaces and jingling,
silver chains and bracelets. Of their
beady-eyed babies strapped to boards.</p>

<p>“Of the wolves which came out at night to
watch him as he sat by his fire; of the beautiful
deer who ran across his path.</p>

<p>“He sang funny songs for the children
and taught them all sorts of games.</p>

</div>


<p>“When it came time to go on, they begged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>him to stay. Never before had they been so
amused, but on he went, and when his bags
were full, and he had a goodly store of food,
he started on to carry out the splendid
thought. Oh, it was a grand thing he was
going to do.</p>

<p>“The little boat went on and on, till houses
were no more to be seen. Splendid forests
lined the banks here and there. Then he
paused, for this was what he was seeking&mdash;a
place where no one lived.</p>

<p>“He landed and went about with a bag of
seeds, and when he reached an open place in
a forest he planted seeds and cuttings of the
trees and vines; then wove a brush fence
about them to keep the deer away. He then
hastened back to his boat and drifted on.</p>

<p>“In many, many places he landed and
planted seeds, and all the orchards of the
Ohio and Mississippi Valley we owe to this
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>“Years after when settlers came looking
for a place to live they chose these spots
where, to their great surprise, they found all
sorts of trees loaded with fruit.</p>

<p>“This man’s name was John Chapman, but
he was nicknamed Johnny Appleseed.</p>

<p>“The settlers were glad indeed when he
appeared and told them the orchards were
the fruit of his labours, and they were all
eager to entertain him.</p>

<p>“And so he ended his life in this land of
fruit and plenty.</p>

<p>“I must tell you a story of one certain little
tree.</p>

<p>“In one of the houses of the settlement
where Johnny Appleseed loved to stay there
lived a dear little boy, just a wee toddler,
named Jack.</p>

<p>“Dearly did the child love to follow the
old man about as he worked, for Johnny Ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>pleseed’s
work was by no means finished
when the trees were bearing fruit.</p>

<p>“Those trees had to be pruned; that meant
all the dead branches had to be cut off. In
the spring the blossoms had to be sprayed to
keep the bugs out of the cores of the fruit;
the trunk had to be watched to see that it was
not marred in any way, as a small gash might
mean the loss of the tree in time.</p>

<p>“One day Johnny, with little Jack, went
to the village post office, and there found a
letter and a package.</p>

<p>“It was the child’s birthday, and he was
most interested in the small parcel thinking
it might be for him.</p>

<p>“‘Jack,’ cried Johnny after reading the
letter, ‘what do you s’pose is in it? Look!’
and he disclosed a mass of brown glossy
seeds. ‘The letter says they are from a wonderful
new kind of apple. How would you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
like an apple tree all your own for a birthday
present?’</p>

<p>“‘Yeth,’ lisped Jack, ‘an apple tree all my
own.’</p>

<p>“‘Then let’s pretend you are another
Johnny Appleseed, starting an orchard.
Bring your cart.’</p>

<p>“Jack’s eyes shone at the word ‘pretend,’
for he dearly loved it, and soon came drawing
the little red cart, in which Johnny
placed the package of seeds.</p>

<p>“‘Now we’ll go and get a lunch,’ said the
old man as they walked to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Jack rapped on the door, and Mother appeared.</p>

<p>“‘If you please, Marm,’ said Johnny, ‘we
are going on an expedition. We have a
birthday and we want to celebrate it, for we
have a wonderful gift. Some seeds which
when planted will bring forth a very unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
apple tree. May we have a lunch for this
journey?’</p>

<p>“Mother’s eyes twinkled as she hastily
placed in a small basket sandwiches and gingerbread.</p>

<p>“Johnny thanked her and away they went.
After what seemed quite a walk for the small
sturdy legs they halted in a grassy nook beside
the brook.</p>

<p>“‘Here,’ said the old man, ‘is a grand place
for your apple tree to grow.’ And together
they bored a hole in the rich earth.</p>

<p>“Jack knelt down and from his chubby
hands dropped the beautiful brown seeds.
Then he kissed his tiny palm and waved it
over the hole as he cried:</p>

<p>“‘Good night, little seeds. Send me a little
tree by and by when you wake up. I’ll
be waiting for it and will take good care of
it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>“They covered the seeds with the dark rich
loam, then ate their lunch. Presently Jack
was thirsty, and the old man fashioned a cup
from a broad leaf and filled it at a near-by
spring. Jack drank, and the little seeds also
drank.</p>

<p>“Then the old man built a picket fence
about the spot so no harm could come to it.
As this was finished the bell on the corn barn
told them dinner was ready.</p>

<p>“‘Mudder,’ cried Jack, bursting in to the
house, ‘we planted the seeds and the tree will
be my own. Isn’t that fine?’</p>

<p>“‘Fine, indeed! I never heard of a better
birthday present. It will last for years and
years, and think of the fruit it will bear!’</p>

<p>“As the child ate he dreamed of the tree as
it would be some day; full of rosy apples,
and he was very proud of that magic spot beside
the brook.</p>

<p>“Each day he ran out to look at it, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
morning he found the ground above the seeds
humped up just a little. Another day the
earth was cracked open, and soon after that
to his great joy, he found a dear little sprig
peeping up at him as though crying, ‘Here I
am! How do you do?’</p>

<p>“He danced about shouting for joy, and
each day after that, could fairly see the little
sprig turn into a tree.</p>

<p>“Johnny told him how the seeds sent tiny
roots down into the earth and pushed the
stem up through the ground, and Jack could
hardly leave the spot which had now grown
so dear.</p>

<p>“When the little tree was thirsty, the rain
gave it drink. The kind wind blew and
blew, bringing fresh sweet air for it to
breathe, and with every whiff it seemed to
swell.</p>

<p>“The spring sunshine warmed it down to
its roots, and in time there were twigs with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
leaf buds, which presently uncurled and
opened wide.</p>

<p>“‘See!’ said Johnny, ‘as the wind blows
them they look like baby hands throwing
kisses!’</p>

<p>“‘Yeth!’ cried Jack, ‘maybe they are the
kitheth I planted.’</p>

<p>“‘To be sure,’ Johnny replied, and together
they watched it grow day after day,
week after week, month after month.</p>

<p>“Jack’s next birthday found the little tree
a picture to behold. The trunk was sturdy,
and on it there were many branches appearing
here and there.</p>

<p>“Jack was quite a boy by this time, and
soon after his little dresses were replaced by
tiny trousers. His baby talk was no more,
and he was now old enough to help care for
the little tree.</p>

<p>“He dug about its roots with his wee spade,
and Johnny showed him how to enrich the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
soil, and told him many things about the care
of trees.</p>

<p>“It was so splendid to know that as the tree
spread its branches in the air, so it spread its
roots under the ground, giving it such a firm
support the wind would have to be very
strong indeed to blow it over.</p>

<p>“‘How does it drink?’ the boy asked one
day.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, such a fine way. It is a story all by
itself,’ replied Johnny. ‘At the end of each
root there are wee spongy mouths. When
the rain comes they drink it and whisper
“Run fast to the trunk.”</p>

<p>“‘As it rushes through the trunk, the trunk
cries in a gruff voice, “Run along to the
branches.”</p>

<p>“‘The branches wave and in sweet tones
cry, “Welcome, run along to the twigs, they
need you.” The twigs drink it and whisper,
“Run along to the stems; they are just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
waiting for you.” The stems send it out to
the tip end of the leaves as they wildly wave
and laugh aloud over their sweet gift, for
this water in the tree is sweet food that nourishes
every part and is called sap.’</p>

<p>“This was a fine story, and every time it
rained Jack watched the little tree, and
thought he could almost hear the voices
sending the moisture on and on.</p>

<p>“As time passed the tree became stronger
and larger, and finally one spring day when
Jack was quite a big boy he found buds on
the branches.</p>

<p>“‘Buds!’ he called in great excitement,
and real buds they were, which the whole
family came out to admire.</p>

<p>“The buds blossomed, and as the petals
snowed down the air was sweet with their
fragrance.</p>

<div class="caption">“They looked like a lot of gnomes dressed for a party”</div>
</div>

<p>“When Jack found baby apples on his tree
he wanted to celebrate, and Mother told him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>that when they were ripe he could invite his
friends and have an apple party.</p>

<p>“An apple party! That would be something
new, and he hastened to tell the good
news at school.</p>

<p>“‘They are wonderful apples,’ he said.
‘No one in this part of the country has any
like them. I tell you we’ll have the fun at
that party. They are turning crimson; you
never saw such a pretty apple tree!’</p>

<p>“A pretty tree it was indeed, and looked
just like a Christmas tree all dressed up.</p>

<p>“One day Johnny pronounced the fruit
ripe and ready to eat.</p>

<p>“‘Hurrah! To-morrow we can have the
party,’ cried Jack, tossing his cap into the air.</p>

<p>“Now the fun began. Mother baked all
sorts of goodies, and the little home was
made spick-and-span; even the door yard was
swept for this occasion.</p>

<p>“The day dawned sweet and clear. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
breakfast Jack ran out to take one look at his
beloved tree, but alas! What do you
s’pose?</p>

<p>“‘What!’ cried the audience in one breath.</p>

<p>“A cow had broken into the orchard,
tramped the fence down, and was feasting on
the rosy fruit! A few branches were broken,
and a sorry sight it was, to be sure.</p>

<p>“Jack shrieked and threw himself on the
ground sobbing:</p>

<p>“‘My dear little tree I planted with my
own baby hands! I loved it so! Now it is
ruined!’</p>

<p>“Johnny Appleseed heard the wail and
hastened to the scene.</p>

<p>“‘It isn’t ruined, Jack; it can be made almost
as good as new. See!’ He skilfully
cut the broken branches, covered the
wounded spots with a paste made of clay,
talking the while to the little tree as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
it were a person whose wounds he was binding
up so carefully.</p>

<p>“‘See!’ he said. ‘This clay paste will
harden and keep the bugs out of the wood
until it can heal over. It will soon be all
right again, but it is too bad. Such a picture
as it was, and the apples are most all gone!’</p>

<p>“The apples!&mdash;Jack suddenly remembered.
‘The apple party was to be to-day!
What can we do?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, my boy, don’t you worry. The
apple party will be to-day just the same.
We’ll take this basket and I’ll show you
something I’ve kept as a surprise.</p>

<p>“‘I planted the seeds that were left over
in the far corner lot, and those trees are as
pretty a sight as you want to see. I have
been watching them as we have this. Come
along.’</p>

<p>“The two trudged on, Jack wiping away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
his tears and beginning to wear a rainbow
smile after the shower.</p>

<p>“‘It’s a joke, isn’t it?’ he said. ‘That cow
had an apple party all by herself. I s’pose
she didn’t like it because I didn’t invite her.</p>

<p>“‘Oh!’ he exclaimed suddenly, ‘there they
are. How beautiful!’</p>

<p>“And indeed they were beautiful. A
number of trees exactly like his own, all looking
so thrifty, and the branches dotted with
rosy fruit.</p>

<p>“‘We’ll pick the apples and tie the stems
to the branches of your own little tree, because
that is where you planned to have
your party,’ said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Together they picked the apples, and with
green string tied the stems to the branches
of the little tree.</p>

<p>“‘You’d hardly know it happened!’ cried
the boy in joyous tones as the work was fin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>ished,
and both stood back to admire; and
true it was, for the apples really seemed to
be growing, and so the apple party was a
success after all.</p>

<p>“The children had their lunch under the
little tree, then each picked his own apple
and ate it before you could say, ‘Jack Robinson.’</p>

<p>“‘I know a great thing to do,’ cried Jack,
as they were about to throw away the core;
‘save the seeds and plant them, and we’ll all
be Johnny Appleseeds. You’ll each have a
grand orchard started on your farm.’</p>

<p>“‘Splendid!’ laughed the old man. ‘If
every seed brings forth a tree there will be
great rejoicing when you take the apples to
market, for they are certainly the best apples
I ever tasted and should bring a good price.’</p>

<p>“Wild with excitement, the children
trooped home, and before long the glossy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
seeds were covered up in the ground, waiting
for the wonderful thing that was to happen
to them.</p>

<p>“In time there were many trees bearing
the rosy fruit. All through one little boy
having such a fine birthday party.</p>

<p>“A tree is the dearest of treasures. I mean
any kind of tree. It does so many things.
It gives fruit and shade. It gives the birds
a place to build their homes, and in return
you have their beautiful music all through
the summer. It gives the squirrels a place
to hide their nuts. From the trunk many insects
find their food.</p>

<p>“If it were not for the trees there would be
no mince pies. From the trees are built the
ships which bring from foreign countries
these many goodies. How could we have
any houses, or any furniture to put in them,
if there were no trees? See that splendid
back log. It has kept us warm all the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
night. It came from a grand old tree that
furnished fuel for many a winter fire.</p>

<p>“And now I must stop, for I fear my tale
has been too long. If it has, please excuse
me.”</p>

<p>“How splendid!” chorused the audience.
And little Allspice begged for another.</p>



<hr />
<h2>THE TALE OF THE STOLEN DOLL CLOTHES</h2>


<p>Nutmeg cried: “I know a grand one! It
happened right in a forest near where I grew.</p>

<p>“You know those woods are full of monkeys,
and they have great times. One of
their traits is to mimic. They usually do
what they see others do, and a good thing
it was for the boy I’m going to tell you about.</p>

<p>“The boy’s name was Enrico. He lived
with his widowed mother at the edge of the
forest. They were very poor and had tried
in many ways to earn money without success.</p>

<p>“The mother was handy with her needle,
and one day a neighbour child came in with
her naked doll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>“‘I’ll dress it,’ said the mother, and from
her scrap bag produced cloth which she soon
fashioned into a quaint gown for the doll.</p>

<p>“‘Mother!’ cried Enrico, much excited,
‘there are many dolls in the town, without
clothes. Could you not make them and I
will sell them? I know I can.’</p>

<p>“‘We’ll try,’ said Mother. She emptied
her purse, ran to the store, and soon returned
heavily laden with gay materials, from which
she fashioned coats, gowns, petticoats,
bonnets, hats and all sorts of things for
dolls.</p>

<p>“Enrico could scarcely wait for the time to
come when he could go and try his luck at
selling them. One morning he started with
his basket well filled.</p>

<p>“His eyes shone, and his heart beat fast as
he hurried along. He had to pass through
the forest to reach the town. It was a long
walk, and a hot day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>“‘I think it is time to eat my lunch,’ he
presently said to himself as he sat down under
the trees. He was obliged to empty the
basket as the lunch was underneath the garments.</p>

<p>“He laid them in a neat pile and found
the sandwiches and fruit which his mother
had carefully prepared. He had barely finished
when his head toppled over against a
tree and he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>“And now comes the best part of the story.
What do you think happened to those lovely
doll clothes?”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop!” cried Allspice. “Do tell
us!”</p>

<p>“As the lad slept, there came a chattering
and whisking about. In a moment dozens of
monkeys came down from the trees. They
gobbled up the crumbs, and then turned to
the doll clothes. Almost before you could
say ‘Jack Robinson,’ they were robed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
tiny garments, and such a sight you never
saw. They looked like a lot of gnomes
dressed for a party. They played all sorts
of games and raced wildly about in the greatest
glee. Suddenly Enrico opened his eyes
on the scene.</p>

<p>“‘The doll clothes. The doll clothes,’ he
wailed. ‘Give them back!’</p>

<p>“The monkeys saucily nodded their heads
and quickly climbed into the trees. Swinging
from the branches with their tails curled
about the limbs, they chattered as though crying,
‘Get them if you can! Get them if you
can!’</p>

<p>“This was serious, and Enrico sat watching
and wondering what he could do, for he
must have the clothes at once.</p>

<p>“Suddenly he remembered the monkey’s
desire to imitate. In the long ago his father
had told him how they did just what they
saw people do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>“It was worth trying, and the boy arose
and threw off his cap.</p>

<p>“At once hats and bonnets were snowed
down upon him. Enrico gathered them up
and placed them in his basket.</p>

<p>“Then off came his coat. Coats of all sorts
now dropped about him.</p>

<p>“Chuckling to himself, Enrico now removed
his other garments, and immediately
tumbled down the gay-coloured gowns and
snowy underwear.</p>

<p>“Enrico gathered them up as fast as he
could, fearing the monkeys might descend
upon him and once more rob him of his treasures.</p>

<p>“He then dressed himself and hurried on.
He found a ready sale for his wares in the
market, and with a purse full of money, and
requests for many more garments of the same
sort, he hastened home to tell his mother of
his good fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>“There was great rejoicing in the little
home, and the day came when Enrico was
selling doll clothes in his own little shop in
the heart of the city.</p>

<p>“A dear little shop it was with a home in
the back where his mother cooked and sewed
on the dainty garments.</p>

<p>“Enrico never tired of telling the children
who came to buy, how he almost lost the first
lot of doll clothes he ever started out to sell.”</p>

<p>General applause followed this interesting
story, while the chairman cried, “Splendid!
Splendid! It was most entertaining, and
now I think the hour has arrived when we
should hear from Beef and her creamy companion,
both of whom remind me of Mary
and her lamb, because where one goes the
other follows.”</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE BROWNIE DOLL</h2>


<p>The odd Brownie now came forward, with
the creamy toddler holding fast to her hand.
They both bowed, and the Brownie began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>“I am commonly known as Beef, and I
come not from the sheep or hog, but from the
cow.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_173.jpg" width="500" height="710" alt="She loved her home" />
<div class="caption">“She loved her home”</div>
</div>

<p>“As to where I come from, it would be hard
to tell where I am not to be found, for I
believe cows roam about over the whole
world.</p>

<p>“You may ride on trains anywhere and
everywhere; you may sail on boats; you may
go up in flying machines, you will always see
cows.</p>

<p>“I do not know of anything that seems
quite as necessary as the cow, both for meat
and for milk.</p>

<p>“I came from a certain cow that spent most
of its time in a green meadow where birds
sang above her head, and a near-by brook
gurgled over the stones, making the sweetest
music.</p>

<p>“Night and morning a maid came with a
shiny pail on her arm; as she milked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Bossy she sang to the accompaniment of the
brook.</p>

<p>“Often two little children came, each with
a silver cup, for a drink of the warm foaming
milk.</p>

<p>“That cow was proud indeed to know that
she furnished food for the little ones.</p>

<p>“She loved her home. She could hear the
chickens clucking, the geese cackling, the
lambs baaing, and the ponies neighing.</p>

<p>“She stood for hours looking off at the
peaceful scene before her and seemed always
content.</p>

<p>“Suddenly she found herself no more in the
meadow but hanging in juicy quarters from
a hook in a butcher shop. These quarters
were cut up into various parts to be used for
steaks, roasts, soup bones, beef tea, and all
sorts of good things.</p>

<p>“At this time the store was trimmed up
with bunches of green leaves and bright red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
berries. Scarlet Christmas bells nodded on
all sides.</p>

<p>“It seemed to be a gay and festive scene.
Sleigh bells jingled, telephones rang constantly,
and finally I was placed in a basket
with other goodies, and the next thing I
knew I was flying over the snow in a bob
sled.</p>

<p>“My basket was presently left on a kitchen
table. Thereupon I was taken from the
package. A fat lady gave me a poke with
her finger, and nodded her head as she said:</p>

<p>“‘Fine cut. Just right for my mince
meat.’ What that was I did not know, but I
was placed in a kettle and bubbled around
in hot water for some time, then I found myself
in something else that was fastened to a
table. A handle twirled and twirled, and I
turned into a fine bunch of stuff, waiting for
I knew not what.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to tell you about my little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
brother Suet, because he never could, he is
so shy.</p>

<p>“I always noticed that when people bought
beef, they chose the parts that had creamy
fat clinging to them. They said they were
sweeter and more tender, and that fat is this
little brother of mine, and that’s why he
clings so closely to me. That’s where he belongs.</p>

<p>“In a moment as I lay in the dish, all
ground up, I felt coming down all over me
wee bits of creamy fat, so you see he still followed
me.</p>

<p>“I was much interested to know what
mince meat was, and I kept my eyes and ears
open to see what would happen next.</p>

<p>“It was a busy scene I looked out upon.
One person was stoning raisins. Another
was peeling apples. All sorts of spices were
being ground. Citron was being cut up very
fine, also orange and lemon peel. The vine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>gar,
molasses, and cider jugs were brought
forth.</p>

<p>“Then everything was put into a wooden
bowl, and as they were chopped they all
seemed to be singing the merriest of tunes.
By and by the mixture was tumbled into a
crock with me, and I found I was beginning
to swell and to be quite important. I was
stirred and stirred, and then various people
came and tasted and smacked their lips and
tasted again. One said, ‘A little more sugar,
don’t you think so?’ Another looking very
wise said, ‘Needs more spice,’ and so I was
doctored and fussed with till finally I was
pronounced just right, and I knew <i>the</i> time
had arrived.</p>

<p>“I felt as one does at a circus when they
have the grand entrée and I fairly held my
breath as I waited for the next act. I was
mince meat at last.</p>

<p>“Suddenly I was poured into what seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
to be a round white blanket. It was so soft
and cushiony I rejoiced over such a fate, but
alas, another blanket was placed over me.
There were no sheets on this bed, and it was
as dark as a pocket. In a moment tiny eyelet
holes appeared, from which I could peep
through up into the eyes of the busy cook.
Then a black door swung open. I was
placed within a dark cavern, the door swung
back, and all was still.</p>

<p>“I felt myself growing warmer and
warmer. My bed turned from soft blankets
to crispy covers. I bubbled and boiled, and
presently when the cover was a golden brown
the door flew open, and once more I came out
into the light of day.</p>

<p>“I was placed in a window to cool, and the
whole family came out to admire me. I felt
so proud I could hardly keep still.</p>

<p>“I knew I was intended for some wonderful
event. Mr. Cinnamon Stick, you said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
this pie was for the Christmas dinner to-morrow.
Is it for an ornament or a decoration
of some sort?”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!” sang the chorus, “you
will soon learn when to-morrow comes what
you will decorate.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the Brownie, in alarm.
“What will happen? What will they do
with this pie?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” laughed Cinnamon Stick, “it’s hard
to tell; they <i>might</i> do any one of a number
of things.</p>

<p>“It <i>might</i> be suspended on chains from the
chandelier, and swing to the tune of an orchestra.</p>

<p>“They <i>might</i> start it rolling across the
hardwood floor down that large hall, and
wager whether it would fall upside down or
downside up.</p>

<p>“There are many things that <i>might</i> be done
with it, but what’s the use of worrying about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
to-morrow. We still have much of the night
to pass away.</p>

<p>“Here! what’s this rolling across the
floor?”</p>



<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE PIE CRUST</h2>


<p>They all looked to see the pie itself rolling
along mysteriously and silently. When it
reached the hearth it spun round and round
for a moment, then paused and began to
speak.</p>

<p>“If you please, Mr. Chairman, and Ladies
and Gentlemen, you are forgetting me, the
most important part of the pie.</p>

<p>“I am the crust, and whoever heard of a pie
of any kind without a crust? No one, of
course, and so since I am really the most important
member of the large family, I think
I should have my turn.”</p>

<p>“You certainly should!” cried Cinnamon
Stick. “I am sorry I neglected to call you.
We are glad, indeed, to hear your story.
What are you made of?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>“I am composed of flour, lard, and water&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’d be ruined if you didn’t put a pinch
of me in,” cried Little Salt eagerly.</p>

<p>“Certainly I would. Thank you for not
allowing me to be spoiled.</p>

<p>“Of course you all know flour is made from
wheat. The wheat plant is a grass which
looks much like barley and rye.</p>

<p>“The varieties are called, bearded, and
beardless or bald.</p>

<p>“Some are planted in spring, for spring or
summer wheat. Other kinds in the fall to be
ready the next season, that is winter wheat.
The latter was at one time thought to be the
best, but lately with improved methods of
manufacture the spring wheat is equally as
good.</p>

<p>“There are two kinds, white and red. Of
the winter wheat the white is best.</p>

<p>“Wheat is chiefly used for flour. The fin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>est,
but not the most wholesome, is nearest
pure starch. The richer parts are found
nearest the skin and are secured in the graham
flour.</p>

<p>“Wheat has been known always, is mentioned
in the Bible, and is found almost
everywhere.</p>

<p>“China wheat is a spring wheat, and this is
where it came from. Once upon a time some
one had a chest of tea sent to him. It was
a wonderful gift to have, and was highly
prized. In that tea was found a curious
grain. No one knew what it was, but they
decided to plant it. From that came wheat,
and was called spring wheat.</p>

<p>“If you have been in the country you know
how the wheat is cut with big machines, and
taken to the barn.</p>

<p>“Then many men appear and they thresh
it. That means to get the chaff, the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
husk, off. Then the grain is taken to the mill
and ground into flour.</p>

<p>“The flour is used for bread, cake, pies,
and almost all of the baked stuff we have.</p>

<p>“Lard is made from pork fat. The fat is
boiled or rendered.</p>

<p>“Water is composed of two parts of hydrogen
and one of oxygen, commonly called
H_2O. Pure water can be obtained by distillation
from the ocean, as is often done at sea.
Some towns on the South American Coast
have been supplied in this way.</p>

<p>“The chief source of supply for water
which falls on the earth is from the ocean.
The heat of the sun raises a vapour from its
surface. This vapour condenses and falls
as rain or snow, either on sea or land. Rain
after falling for some time is almost pure and
for that reason is called soft. Hard water
contains various minerals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all about the crust. It isn’t very
interesting, nor funny, but it is good and
everybody loves it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is good, and most necessary to
every pie,” declared the Cinnamon Doll.</p>

<p>“And now suppose we wish for the Story
Sprite. She is a dear and we have time for
just one more story.”</p>

<p>This wish was hardly expressed when the
sound of bells was heard and there before
them stood the Story Lady, bringing with
her a joyous shower of bells.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dearies, this is the last time I can
come!</p>

<p>“It is Christmas, as you know, and many
Christmas parties are awaiting me, but I just
had to keep my promise to you.</p>

<p>“This time I want to tell you a Christmas
tale I am sure you will enjoy and
love.</p>

<p>It is called:</p>

<h2>HOW JACK FILLED THE STOCKINGS.</h2>

<p>“It was Christmas Eve. The younger children
were snugly tucked in bed, while Jack
sat staring at the empty stockings swinging
from the mantel shelf in the gleaming fire-light.</p>

<p>“Jack was only twelve, and the man of the
house. His face was very grave as he gazed
alternately at the stockings, then at his
mother bustling about tidying up the room.</p>

<p>“She finally sat down, declaring sadly:
‘It’s no use, Jack. I haven’t a penny to
spare; the stockings will have to go empty.’</p>

<p>“The boy spoke not a word, but watched
the fire sputter and crackle as though perhaps
it might solve the problem.</p>

<p>“Of one thing he was certain: the stockings
should not go empty if he could help
it.</p>

<p>“The fire <i>did</i> show him the way, for sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>denly
the logs began to send out tiny sparks
and snap for all the world like popcorn.</p>

<p>“‘Mother!’ he cried suddenly, ‘I have an
idea. I’m going out.’</p>

<p>“‘Dress warm then, dear, and good luck to
you.’</p>

<p>“The boy hurried out into the night, and
<i>such</i> a night!</p>

<p>“Snowflakes were flying thick and fast,
and above his head the ice-coated trees spread
their friendly branches. He loved the crisp,
sharp air, and raised his face that the flakes
might lodge and sting.</p>

<p>“Soon he reached the busy street and
watched keenly for a chance to earn a dime.</p>

<p>“Suddenly he saw a woman carrying a suitcase,
running for the car, while at her side
toddled a child trying in vain to keep up
with her.</p>

<p>“‘Let me help, may I?’ asked Jack wistfully.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

toy store" />
<div class="caption">“He chose the busiest corner where there was a wonderful
toy store”</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Oh, if you only would,’ replied the
woman, grateful indeed for the aid.</p>

<p>“As they reached the corner she slipped a
silver piece into his hand. The car stopped,
then whizzed on, leaving Jack staring at the
quarter, hardly able to believe it.</p>

<p>“‘A good beginning,’ he murmured, and
ran into a near-by store, where he purchased
a few ears of popcorn and a small jar of molasses.</p>

<p>“Mother, much surprised, welcomed the
gifts and boy with open arms.</p>

<p>“‘I earned them, Mother! Make some
corn balls and candy while I try again,’ and
away he went.</p>

<p>“This time he was not so successful. Every
one seemed busy and hurried past him,
not even glancing at the eager, earnest
face.</p>

<p>“On one corner a hand-organ man was
grinding out his music. Jack watched to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the people stop and drop pennies into his little
cup.</p>

<p>“Suddenly the boy had an inspiration.
He could sing like a bird. In fact he had
been soloist of a boy choir in the town where
they had lived before coming to the city.</p>

<p>“That work he loved, and was never so
happy as, when clothed in his robes, walking
up the aisle, singing while the great splendid
organ pealed out its glorious music.</p>

<p>“One song, the Christmas Lullaby, was his
special favourite. He always sang it at
Christmas time. Why not sing it here on the
street?</p>

<p>“It was sweeter than hand-organ music,
and surely people ought to be willing to give
a few pennies to hear it.</p>

<p>“No sooner thought than done, and Jack
darted down the street a few blocks away
from the hand-organ man.</p>

<p>“He chose the busiest corner where there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
was a wonderful toy store. In the window
was a tree covered with gifts. The lights
twinkled and danced as though cheering
him on, and so there he paused and sang.</p>

<p>“He was a beautiful child. Indeed, in
the fashionable church at home he had been
called the Christ child, and now as he sang,
many were attracted by his face and the clear
sweet tones.</p>

<p>“They listened and passed on, leaving in
the shabby cap many bits of silver.</p>

<p>“After a time the boy walked on, halting
at various corners to sing, and presently
found himself in front of a church.</p>

<p>“The music of the great organ pierced the
air and as the door swung to and fro, he saw
a large audience with many children gaily
dressed, waiting expectantly.</p>

<p>“Jack was tired and cold. He longed to
be enfolded in the light and warmth within
and listen to the music, and he quietly crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
inside up a stairway, then down to the front.
No one was there and he leaned forward to
see a wonderful tree. It sparkled with tinsel,
while coloured lights gleamed here and
there like shining jewels breathing a halo
about the head of the Christmas Angel standing
on the topmost branch.</p>

<p>“The outstretched arms seemed to pronounce
a blessing on the fruit of this tree
waiting to be showered on the many little
ones, who stood admiring and exclaiming
over this vision of beauty.</p>

<p>“It was an enormous tree. The top
branches were fastened securely to a heavy
pole which was thrown across the chancel
and rested in the grooves on the hand-carved
posts which stood either side of the entrance
to this sacred place.</p>

<p>“Jack, fascinated by the scene, watched
hungrily every detail, and as a thirsty flower
holds up its dainty head for the first rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>drops,
so the boy eagerly drank in every note
of the music which he knew so well.</p>

<p>“He longed to be a choir boy once more,
but he was timid and bashful and feared to
make any effort in this direction in a strange
city.</p>

<p>“As he pondered on how to gain the coveted
position, he watched the tree being
stripped of its fruit and placed in many outstretched
hands.</p>

<p>“He gazed wistfully on the joyous scene,
but was suddenly startled by a flash of light,
which, from his position, he saw was a thread
of flame leaping upwards toward the Christmas
Angel.</p>

<p>“There was but one thing to do, and he
was the one to do it. Without a thought for
himself he sprang for the pole, hung by his
toes, and in an instant the flaming branch
was broken from the tree and crushed in his
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>“Below a quick cry of ‘Fire!’ rang out, then
was heard the shriek of a child.</p>

<p>“Jack knew the impending panic must be
averted instantly, and as he swung up on to
the pole, he wound his limbs about it, and
there perched in the topmost branches, a veritable
Christ Child, he sang, as he never sang
before, the Christmas Lullaby.</p>

<p>“The cries below ceased. The audience
stared in amazement. Had he fallen from
the blue skies painted on the ceiling by a
master hand or had one of the Murillo angels,
hovering amongst the billowy clouds,
come to life?</p>

<p>“Those who heard never forgot the pathos
of the plaintive melody.</p>

<p>“The choirmaster listened breathlessly, for
here was the soloist he had for months been
vainly seeking.</p>

<p>“The organist, wild with delight over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
heavenly music, coming from he knew not
where, followed gently with the organ accompaniment,
the flute-like tones blending
with the bird notes of the boy.</p>

<p>“Higher and higher soared the voice of the
Christmas Angel, while the people gazed entranced.
Such tender sweetness it had
never been their privilege to hear.</p>

<p>“Surely the Baby Jesus was being lulled
to sleep by the angelic music, which at last
slowly and gently died away.</p>

<p>“A moment of tense silence was followed
by a rustle; the tension was broken and Jack
swung himself back to the gallery, to be
greeted by many outstretched hands.</p>

<p>“He had many questions to answer and before
the child realised it, he had told the
story of limp stockings hanging by the chimneyside
at home, and how hard he had tried
to fill them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>“His pathetic tale, together with his daring
efforts to quench the fire and avert a
panic, moved many to tears.</p>

<p>“You all know what followed. How he
was driven home in state in a grand sleigh
drawn by a pair of prancing horses, and how
his new-found friends not only filled the
stockings, but then and there engaged him as
soloist of the boy choir at such a salary that
his mother need work no more, and they were
all comfortable and happy for many a day.</p>

<p>“And now good-bye, and I wish you a very
Merry Christmas.”</p>

<p>With that the Story Elf vanished, and her
audience chorused:</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that lovely?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, it was,” declared Mr. Cinnamon
Stick; “and now I believe we have heard
from every one of this large family&mdash;”</p>
<hr />
<h2>TALE OF THE INTERROGATION POINT</h2>

<p>“No, you haven’t! No, you haven’t!”
cried a sprightly voice, and there appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the queerest figure imaginable, coming apparently
up from the floor like a Jack in the
box.</p>

<p>He seemed to be a combination of every
one of them, and before he had even spoken
he seemed to be asking a question.</p>

<p>“Look at me. Guess who I am.”</p>

<p>“An Interrogation Point,” announced the
Vinegar Doll.</p>

<p>“Yes, but an Interrogation Point asks a
question. Who can answer it?”</p>

<p>The dolls leaned forward curiously examining
this figure.</p>

<p>His head seemed made of suet, and he
wore a hat adorned with tiny beef croquettes
about the edge of the brim. Sprays of raisins
and currants wandered over the crown,
and about his neck was a necklace of allspice
with dangles of cloves, cinnamon and nutmegs.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt sprinkled his clothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
which seemed made from orange and lemon
peel. About his waist was a queer girdle
from which wee sugar bowls, molasses jugs
and vinegar cruets jingled together, while he
tossed gay coloured apples into the air,
caught them skilfully and then disposed of
them in various pockets.</p>

<p>With a gay nod he cried, “Can no one answer
the question? Let me tell you a little
about myself, and then perhaps you
can.</p>

<p>“You have all told how necessary you are.
Let me tell you there would never have been
a mince pie without me, nor anything else
worth while.</p>

<p>“Let me ask of you growing things, how
did you happen to grow? How did any of
you happen to be? Some one had to plant
the seeds. Some one had to take care of the
trees, vines and shrubs after they started to
grow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>“Where there was no rain, water had to be
carried. The trees and vines had to be
tended, trimmed, and cultivated. When the
fruit was finally ready, it had to be packed
and shipped all over the world.</p>

<p>“Even after it found its way into that
kitchen, what happened? Everybody was&mdash;what&mdash;what
was everybody doing? Now
do tell me what this interrogation point
stands for? Think!” he pleaded.</p>

<p>Everybody thought. They screwed up
their faces and thought some more. They
took one foot out from under them and
thought. They put the other foot under
them and thought again.</p>

<p>What was everybody doing to get the pie
ready&mdash;chopping, grinding, baking.</p>

<p>Suddenly everybody beamed and chorused:
“Working! Everybody was working!
You are called Work!”</p>

<p>“To be sure I am, and a lot of work it took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
to make this pie. All over the world many,
many people had many busy days.</p>

<p>“Can’t you just see them picking the raisins;
sugaring the citron; grinding spice; cutting
the wheat; packing the oranges; taking
care of the cow; gathering the apples, and
crushing them in the mill for cider?</p>

<p>“Oh, my dears, there is always work.
Johnny Appleseed did an endless amount of
work, and see what came from it.</p>

<p>“The one who packed that box of tea and
happened to drop a grain of wheat therein,
did a wonderful thing. That tiny grain
brought us a kind of wheat we might never
have had. Can’t you just see them planting
that tiny seed? They watched it grow,
tending the little sprout till it finally came
to maturity, and more grains were planted.
At last there was a wonderful crop of wheat,
all due to your humble servant Work.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="500" height="341" alt="Best pie you ever made, my dear" />
<div class="caption">“Best pie you ever made, my dear”</div>
</div>

<p>With a sunny nod he vanished, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>looked and listened, but not even a clank of
his girdle charms did they hear.</p>

<p>“Well! Well!” cried Cinnamon.
“Wasn’t he fine? Who would ever have
thought of him as belonging to mince pie. I
fear we were all forgetting that most important
point, and glad I am he remembered to
appear. And now, my dears, the dawn is
breaking, we must return.”</p>

<p>“But the mouse!” cried timid Allspice.
“What about the mouse?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, the mouse!” chorused the audience
breathlessly. “What about the
mouse?”</p>

<p>Cinnamon Stick said no word, but pointed
a long thin finger toward the clock.</p>

<p>The clock struck one (which was really
half-past five), the mouse ran down, and the
chain clinkety clanked as he hopped to the
floor and ran away to his hole, and was seen
no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>His disappearance seemed a signal, and at
once was heard a joyful chorus. As the dolls
sang they formed a procession, and two by
two marched back to the clock and wound
their way about the spiral columns.</p>

<p>The Pie Crust was at the head and settled
down in the pan, its cover upheld as by an
invisible hand. The dolls jumped into their
places, the cover was slowly dropping, when
suddenly up popped the head of the Vinegar
Cruet.</p>

<p>“The Gifts!” he cried. “You forgot the
Gifts!”</p>

<p>At that up popped every other head, crying
in chorus:</p>

<p>“The Gifts! The Gifts! You forgot the
Gifts!”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t forget. They are on the
way.”</p>

<p>As Mother and Jack watched, suddenly a
red-coated, white, fur-trimmed figure ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>peared.
On his back was a basket piled
high with candy. He made his way to the
clock, and as he stood over the pie he cried
in the jolliest of tones:</p>

<p>“Open your mouths and shut your eyes,
and I’ll give you something to make you
wise.”</p>

<p>Open popped the dolls’ mouths, looking
like a lot of birds, each waiting for a worm,
and all were filled to the brim with sweets.</p>

<p>They then nestled down close together.
The top crust settled in place. The flames
flickered and died out; then all was still.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day was crisp and bright. Father
came, and a joyous time they all had
over their gifts.</p>

<p>The turkey dinner was delicious, and presently
the mince pie appeared in all its glory.</p>

<p>Such a beautiful mince pie as it was!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
